On the other hand, the stagnant fund movement in Grayscale's GBTC might suggest a wait-and-see approach from its investors."
2024-07-02,"Bitcoin Network Fees Drop, Pressuring Miners' Revenue","According to Bloomberg, network fees have significantly decreased, putting pressure on miners' revenue. The average price of these fees has dropped to between $3 and $5, a significant decrease from the $45 average in January, as per data from Kaiko. This decrease has made the mining process less profitable, as costs such as energy, wages, and rent remain practically unchanged. In the past, Bitcoin price rallies following a halving have typically helped miners offset the drop in rewards. The price of Bitcoin has increased after the previous three halvings. However, Bitcoin's price has remained relatively stable since the software change on April 19. In April, fees had spiked to almost $150 following the halving, due to a surge in nonfungible tokens being minted on the blockchain. This increase provided a short-term relief for miners before the fees returned to average levels. One of the largest Bitcoin miners, Marathon Digital, sold 390 Bitcoin in May and plans to sell more tokens to manage its finances. According to Kaiko, the risk of forced Bitcoin selling from miners may continue in the coming months. The research firm also predicts that the revenue squeeze will lead to mergers as miners seek to consolidate assets and increase efficiency. This consolidation trend is expected to continue as the impact of the halving reverberates throughout the industry. Kaiko cited the example of miner Riot Platforms Inc., without providing further details."

2024-07-02,Bitcoin's Volatility Index Hits Lowest Since February Amid Price Drop,"According to CoinDesk, Deribit's DVOL index, which gauges volatility expectations, has dropped to its lowest level since early February. This decrease in volatility, coupled with a price drop, indicates a lack of demand for options. A resurgence in BTC's price to $70,000 could potentially boost the DVOL index. In the stock market, corrections are usually accompanied by an increase in metrics like the VIX index, which measures volatility expectations. However, this is not the case in the bitcoin market, despite the fact that cryptocurrency prices are often positively correlated with technology stocks. For example, bitcoin's price has fallen 10% from over $70,000 in the past four weeks. During this time, Deribit's bitcoin volatility index DVOL has decreased from an annualized 53% to 42%, marking its lowest point since early February. Implied volatility is positively influenced by the demand for options or derivative contracts. These contracts give the buyer the right to purchase or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price at a future date. The decrease in the DVOL index amid the price correction suggests a calm market environment, with investors less likely to panic or seek out protective puts or hedging bets. David Brickell, head of international distribution at Toronto-based crypto platform FRNT Financial, explains that the market has been range-bound with low realized volatility since started to decline from its highs. He notes a lack of appetite to buy volatility into the summer months, and in the absence of real demand, the market drops lower. Volatility selling is a common crypto strategy where investors sell or write options in a dull market, thereby lowering implied volatility. The seller receives a premium for promising to compensate the buyer in case of wild price swings. According to Brickell, a renewed upswing in BTC to levels above $70,000 will likely revive demand for options and boost the DVOL implied volatility index. BTC's price has been positively correlated with the DVOL index throughout this bull cycle."

Currently, Bitcoin is down 14% from its all-time high of $73,737, achieved in March following the successful introduction of several exchange-traded funds. Ju referred to the current price action as 'boring,' suggesting it offers an investment opportunity.

Similarly, Peter Brandt, a well-known commodity trader, has predicted that Bitcoin could reach $150,000 during this cycle. Despite this, Brandt also acknowledges the possibility that Bitcoin may not reach a new peak and could potentially drop to the $55,000 level."

This comes as Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, briefly surpassed the $63,000 mark before falling back down. In the last 24 hours, BTC has fluctuated from $61,825 to $63,600, marking an approximate 3% increase. At present, Bitcoin is trading at $62,710. Mow, who is also a Bitcoin maximalist, took to social media to share his perspective on BTC's current value, based on his own criteria. He referenced 'Omega Law' to assert that Bitcoin is 'incredibly undervalued' at present. The term 'Omega' refers to 'Omega candles', which Mow anticipates will propel BTC to $1 million virtually overnight, 'soon'. His definition of 'soon' encompasses this year or the next, as per his recent tweets where he claimed that BTC is on track to reach $1 million. Mow's prediction is grounded in the observation that spot ETFs have been actively accumulating Bitcoin since mid-January, following approval from the SEC. Companies such as BlackRock, Fidelity, VanEck, and Grayscale were among those that received approval. According to Mow, the creation of these ETFs resulted in a demand shock for Bitcoin, while the fourth BTC halving in April led to a supply shock. He believes that when these two 'Bitcoin shocks' intersect, the price will surge past $1 million. In addition to Bitcoin, these companies have also filed to launch spot exchange-traded funds. The SEC granted initial approval in late May, with the final approval expected to be announced on July 2. This has generated anticipation within the crypto community, similar to the excitement that preceded the approval of Bitcoin ETF trading."

These 44 addresses collectively hold a staggering 1,350,707 Bitcoins, valued at 85 billion USD. Lopp's revelation provides a glimpse into the concentration of Bitcoin wealth. The fact that these addresses have not recorded any outgoing transactions suggests that the owners are holding onto their Bitcoins, possibly anticipating future value appreciation.

2024-07-01,"Bitcoin's Programmability to Influence Runes and Inscriptions, Says Ordinals Founder Casey","According to Odaily, Ordinals founder Casey has stated on platform X that runes and inscriptions will have programmability similar to . This implies that improvements to Bitcoin's expressiveness will also impact the performance of runes and inscriptions. For instance, OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY will allow public coin minting to be organized into OP_CTV trees, which will expand into UTXO subpages containing runes. This will enable users to obtain runes or conduct transactions that are not mined and do not pay any fees, thereby necessitating users to bid for participation in public coin minting and pay fees to acquire runes. SIGHASH_GROUP will allow for more flexible use of signatures to commit a group of inputs and outputs. It will permit the sale of variable quantities of runes from a single UTXO without the need for splitting, as users can commit to input UTXO, output runes, and payment output. This also makes it easier to elevate runes to the lightning network for some mysterious technical reasons. The standardization of the Taproot signature appendix, which carves out unstructured data, will allow for the creation of inscriptions in a single transaction, rather than requiring a commitment transaction and a reveal transaction. There are more new features to look forward to in the future."

This has led to many mining companies slowing down their investments in mining machines, with some firms turning to other Proof of Work (PoW) currencies to hedge against market uncertainty. The term 'hash price' was coined by Bitcoin mining service company Luxor. It refers to the expected value that can be generated per day per 1 PH/second or 1 TH/second of computing power. This metric quantifies the profit that miners can expect from a specific amount of computing power. The drop in hash price indicates a decrease in the profitability of Bitcoin mining, which has led to a slowdown in investment by mining companies. The shift of some companies towards other PoW currencies is a strategy to hedge against the uncertainty in the market. This move could potentially diversify their investments and reduce the risk associated with the volatility of a single cryptocurrency. However, the overall impact of this shift on the Bitcoin market and the cryptocurrency industry as a whole remains to be seen."

Schiff noted that Bitcoin's value has fallen by over 15% as Q2 draws to a close, while gold has recorded a 4% gain during the same period.

Bitcoin's recent price movements indicate a drop from just under $71,000 to approximately $60,800, marking a more than 14% decrease. This decline follows a significant rise earlier in the year, where Bitcoin surged nearly fivefold from its January 2023 lows to a new all-time high above $73,500 in mid-March.

Julio Moreno from CryptoQuant has observed a decrease in demand, with a reduction of 23,000 Bitcoins in the past 30 days, which he associates with the current price correction. Schiff's comments and Moreno's observations highlight the volatile nature of Bitcoin and the potential risks for investors who switch from traditional assets like gold to cryptocurrencies."

2024-06-29,Bitcoin's Consolidation Predicted by Renowned Trader John Bollinger,"According to U.Today, renowned trader John Bollinger recently shared his prediction on the X social media platform that , the leading cryptocurrency, would continue to consolidate within its current range. Bollinger noted that despite a two- reversal at the lower Bollinger Band, the flagship cryptocurrency failed to achieve a price bounce. On June 25, Bollinger, the creator of one of the most widely used trading tools, stated that the 'lovely' two-bar reversal should have been enough to trigger a price jump. He suggested that the cryptocurrency could potentially test the highs, but this did not occur. Bollinger, in 2021, had expressed that the two-bar reversal was among his favorite trading patterns, even referring to it as his 'bread and butter' trade. He explained that the ideal two-bar reversal happens when both bars are greater than the average true range (ATR), a commonly used market volatility indicator. According to Bollinger, both bars should be big-range bars. The first bar should close outside the upper Bollinger Band followed by a close inside, or vice versa. Bollinger believes this strategy is particularly useful for counter-trend trades. As per CoinGecko data, the price of the leading cryptocurrency is currently at $60,181. It managed to reclaim the $62,000 level earlier today, but the bullish momentum quickly fizzled out."
