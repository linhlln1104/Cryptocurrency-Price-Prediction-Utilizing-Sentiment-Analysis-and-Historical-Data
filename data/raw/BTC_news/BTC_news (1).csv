3/9/2024,Tesla and SpaceX Hold $1.34B in Bitcoin Across Multiple Wallets,"According to CryptoPotato, Arkham Intelligence has disclosed that Tesla currently holds 11.51K , valued at $780 million, distributed across 68 addresses, while SpaceX possesses 8.29K BTC, totaling $560 million, spread across 28 wallets. These findings are supported by on-chain fund flows that align with financial disclosures from both companies. Tesla made a significant entry into the crypto market with a $1.5 billion BTC purchase in January 2021, followed by two major sales: $272 million in Q1 2021 and $936 million in Q2 2022. Tesla briefly allowed Bitcoin transactions for purchasing vehicles between March 24 and May 12, 2021, as confirmed by its Tesla Intel Exchange Bounty, which revealed a Tesla car acquisition linked to this extensive cluster of its holdings. Tesla began its engagement with Bitcoin by investing $1.5 billion in February 2021, acquiring approximately 43,000 BTC. At the same time, the company announced its acceptance of Bitcoin as a payment method. However, subsequent decisions led to a reversal of this policy, with Tesla reducing its holdings of the premier crypto asset. Tesla's public statements have not acknowledged any changes to its Bitcoin holdings. Even the most recent earnings report, issued in January, makes no mention of the cryptocurrency. In fact, its Q4 report showed that the car manufacturing giant held 9,720 Bitcoin holdings worth $387 million and refrained from buying or selling the asset throughout the quarter. Meanwhile, not much is known about SpaceX's Bitcoin holdings due to its status as a privately held entity. Despite this, the WSJ report revealed that the spacecraft manufacturing firm altered its Bitcoin investments by $373 million between 2021 and 2022, including the divestiture of a certain portion of the asset."
3/9/2024,Bitcoin Whales Hold on to Their Assets Despite BTC Prices Surpassing $70K,"According to Cointelegraph: Bitcoin addresses holding substantial amounts of BTC, otherwise known as ""Bitcoin whales,"" are persisting in their holdings even as Bitcoin values soar past $70,000. Current on-chain data suggests that these large holders are not hasty to sell during this rally, which has propelled Bitcoin to new record highs. Bitcoin addresses with at least 1,000 BTC. Source: LookIntoBitcoin The number of unique addresses possessing at least 1,000 BTC has surged, with 2,104 whales recorded as of March 7. Though this number is still less than February 2021's high of 2,489 addresses, the increasing count points to continued interest from significant stakeholders. This rise could also be linked to the U.S spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which exceeded cumulative trading volume of $52.5 billion on March 4. The whales' reticence to offload their Bitcoin holdings at such elevated prices indicates a belief that the market still has room for growth. Large-scale trades have a considerable impact on pricing, making Bitcoin whales an essential market force. Bitcoin whales holding 1,000–10,000 BTC, 1-year change. Source: Julio Moreno on X Data from Glassnode reveals an unprecedented uptick in transfers from exchanges to whales in March, going ""parabolic,"" while transfers from whales to exchanges have seen only a modest increase compared to previous market periods. This data, coupled with the continued demand for BTC from spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S, represents an influx of new investors into Bitcoin. This also signifies a lower impulse for profit-taking by affluent investors, even amid peak BTC prices. According to various technical, on-chain, and fundamental indicators, Bitcoin's next significant target might reach around $92,500, setting the stage for more exciting developments in the coming months within the Bitcoin market."

3/10/2024,Stanford Blyth Fund Allocates 7% of Portfolio to Bitcoin,"According to CryptoPotato, the Stanford Blyth Fund, a student-run investment entity at Stanford University, purchased Bitcoin ( ) at $45,000 in February after a scholar pitched the asset during a meeting. Kole Lee, a computer science major and leader at the Stanford Blockchain Club, revealed in a tweet that the Blyth Fund has allocated approximately 7% of its portfolio to Bitcoin following the purchase. Established in 1978 by an anonymous donor in honor of legendary banker Charles Blyth, the Blyth Fund manages a six-figure portion of Stanford University’s endowment through investments in assets like stocks and bonds. The fund supports education by giving students an opportunity to invest their money and channeling 25% of the investment returns to Stanford University’s financial aid. During Lee's pitch to the fund in February, he focused on crypto market cycles, exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows, and a hedge against ""monetary chaos and war."" Lee suggested investing in the iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) issued by BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager. The outcome of the pitch was a BTC purchase and a 7% portfolio allocation to the leading digital asset. The Blyth Fund's purchase highlights the rising adoption of the relatively novel digital asset. The launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States has driven BTC adoption to unprecedented levels, allowing for the inflow of billions of dollars in capital from the traditional finance sector. Heavy ETF volumes and inflows have also driven the price of BTC to levels last seen in November 2021, during the last bull cycle. Data from CoinMarketCap shows BTC changed hands at $66,700 at the time of writing. Meanwhile, the ten ETFs witnessed their biggest trading volume day on March 5, recording roughly $10 billion, with IBIT alone responsible for the largest portion."

3/10/2024,"Bitcoin Miners Face Challenges as Halving Nears, Prices Could Drop","According to CryptoPotato, Fidelity Digital Assets recently reported that while Bitcoin ( ) holders typically expect the quadrennial reward halving to boost prices, miners must actively strategize to plan for the upcoming event to prevent going bankrupt. The halving event, expected on or around April 19, will reduce miners' earned Bitcoin by 50%. Analyst Daniel Gray states that miners must sustain their current hash rate, energy consumption, and infrastructure while facing ongoing competition from the entire network, all striving to maintain profitability amidst the same challenges. Miners must be proactive rather than merely maintaining their position within the network if they are to profit. Gray highlights that miners must continually strive to increase their hashrate efficiency, secure lower-cost energy from more economical sources, and expand their infrastructure to accommodate new machines. However, given the competitive landscape, every miner vies for the same resources. Fidelity notes that the period following the halving poses significant challenges as Bitcoin adjusts to the immediate reduction in rewards, necessitating miners to possess capital reserves to cushion the decline in revenue. Nonetheless, the report suggests that new layers could introduce fresh use cases and attract more users as the protocol evolves. Despite the historical trend of weaker miners exiting the market post-halving, the industry has consistently rebounded with increased miner participation and hashrate, showing the resilience of both the network and the industry. Notably, previous halvings in 2012 and 2016 saw the hashrate dip temporarily before rebounding. While Bitcoin’s recent surge to over $69,000 has been remarkable, analysts at JPMorgan caution that the asset’s forthcoming halving event could exert downward pressure on prices, potentially leading to a dip to $42,000. According to analysts, Bitcoin’s production cost has historically been a floor for its prices. Post-halving production costs could double to approximately $53,000, which might decrease the Bitcoin network’s hashrate as fewer miners compete to produce . The projected $42,000 price level is also where the analysts anticipate that Bitcoin prices will stabilize once the halving event’s euphoria subsides after April. Alessandro Cecere, head of marketing at mining pool Luxor, notes that even if the mining reward halves, miners could still maintain profitability if Bitcoin’s price reaches $100,000, maintaining their earnings over time."

3/12/2024,Bitcoin Price Fluctuates Following US Consumer Price Index Release,"According to CryptoPotato, Bitcoin's price experienced fluctuations of several hundred dollars after the US Bureau of Labor Statistics released the Consumer Price Index (CPI) numbers for February 2024. The actual numbers were slightly higher than predicted, but the overall trend indicates that inflation rates are calming. The general expectations for the core CPI forecasted a 0.3% increase compared to the previous month. However, the actual difference was just 0.1% (3.7% against 3.8%). The previous month's increase for the metric that excludes more volatile sectors like food and energy was 3.9%. The total CPI for February 2024 compared to February last year was at 3.2% – slightly higher than the 3.1% anticipated. Approximately a year ago, the US CPI announcements brought enhanced volatility to the crypto market. However, that hasn't been the case for the past several months. The trend remains the same for now, with Bitcoin's price going down by 0.5% before recovering all losses and returning to $72,000.

3/14/2024,"10X Research CEO: Bitcoin to Hit $77,000 in April, $146,000 in 90 Days","The CEO of 10X Research, Markus Thielen, has published a bullish forecast for Bitcoin that suggests the digital gold may reach $77,000 in early April, and $146,000 within the next 90 days. This prediction is based on historic trends and the theory of diminishing returns. According to Thielen, Bitcoin, after hitting a new high, typically undergoes a consolidation period of 10 to 20 days, after which the price continues to rise. Thielen's analysis predicts that Bitcoin could very well reach $99,000 in May 2024. The analysis also outlines a long-term target of $125,000 for Bitcoin, a figure derived from June 2023 and November 2023 predictions. By mid-summer, Thielen posits that Bitcoin could likely reach $146,000, representing an almost 114% growth from the current price of around $68,300. A key driver in this bull market, according to Thielen, is the imbalance in supply and demand of Bitcoin spot ETFs, contributing to the coin's price surge. A notable point Thielen raised is that dips in the Bitcoin market will be actively purchased as long as ETFs continue to see inflows.  While the analysis presented by the CEO of 10X Research is optimistic, it aligns with Bitcoin's historical trend of substantial growth post-halving. This prediction adds to the growing body of bullish forecasts accentuating the dominant role Bitcoin could play in the coming months. A word of caution, however: cryptocurrency investments are volatile and carry substantial risk. It is advisable to conduct personal research or seek financial advice before making any investment decisions."

3/15/2024,Bitcoin Price Corrects After Weeks of Rallying: Technical and On-Chain Analysis,"According to CryptoPotato, Bitcoin's price has corrected by around 10% after weeks of aggressive rallying, leaving market participants wondering whether a deeper crash should be expected. Looking at the daily chart, the price has been rallying over the last few months, consistently making higher highs and lows. However, the $75K resistance level rejected Bitcoin lower, and the market is currently dropping below the $68K support level. There is still a significant support level available around the $60K mark to prevent a crash. Meanwhile, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has been showing a clear bearish divergence lately, indicating that the market is likely to go through a more prolonged correction phase. On the 4-hour chart, the price action looks much clearer. The market has made a high below the $75K level and is currently testing the $68K support zone. A bearish breakout is likely to lead to a further decline toward the $60K level in the short term. The RSI showing values below 50% confirms that the momentum has now switched to bearish, and a further drop seems probable. Analyzing the underlying fundamentals of the network, the Bitcoin Short-Term Holder Spent Output Profit Ratio (STH SOPR) has been making a new record high, indicating that the short-term holders have been aggressively realizing their profits. Their selling pressure has definitely contributed to the recent price drop. Until this selling behavior continues, the price can still drop lower in the coming weeks."

The nation began purchasing Bitcoin in September 2021 when it was valued at $51,769.

However, the investment returned to profitability when Bitcoin surpassed the average purchase price of $42,600 in February. El Salvador currently holds 2,864 , worth $188 million, acquired across 12 transactions at an average price of $42,630 each.

3/17/2024,"Bitcoin ETF Launch Attracts Institutional Investors, Predicts Higher Year-End Value","According to Bloomberg, the launch of Bitcoin ETF in the US earlier this year has attracted institutional investors and new fund flows, said Teng at an event in Bangkok. He added that the cryptocurrency market is just getting started. Teng had previously estimated that Bitcoin would end the year at around $80,000, but now sees it exceeding that value due to reduced supply and continued demand. He emphasized that this forecast is his personal view and that the rally won't be a straight line, with ups and downs being beneficial for the market. The world's largest cryptocurrency has surged 56% this year, reaching an all-time high of almost $73,798 last week. This rally has sparked concerns of a bubble among some investors, leading to volatility and selloffs in recent sessions. Since the approval of US spot Bitcoin ETFs in January, there have been relentless inflows into these funds.

Attestor Capital, a London-based hedge fund renowned for its focus on distressed assets and private equity, has reportedly filed a lawsuit against Lemma Technologies, a claim seller for FTX. Cumulative holdings of top six FTX claims holders. Source: Claims Market by Cherokee Acquisition Renowned as one of the most considerable buyers of the exchange’s bankruptcy assets, Attestor purchased at least $400 million worth of claims as of February, according to Claims Market data. After the firm reported a 200% profit on these investments, it lodged a lawsuit against Lemma, the seller of one of the most significant FTX accounts it bought. Attestor claims that Lemma agreed to sell FTX claims at the price of $58 million in June 2023 but later reneged on the deal as cryptocurrency prices, including Bitcoin's 130% surge over the past year, soared. Subsequently, Lemma chose to keep the claim, invoking what Attestor alleges as a clear case of ""seller's remorse"". Lemma has yet to publicly disclose its perspective on the lawsuit and has not submitted a defense against the legal filing by Attestor in New York. In separate legal developments, Lemma’s principal investor, Junho Bang, has reportedly been indicted by South Korean authorities for allegedly stealing digital assets from the collapsed crypto lending firm, Haru Invest.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin (BTC) remained relatively stable around $68670, and the broader CoinDesk 20 Index saw an increase of 0.7%.

As data from Top Ledger and OurNetwork indicate, Solana-based decentralized exchanges recorded a trading volume of $30 billion this month, tenfold against the same time last year. An increase in “SOL” mentions across social media platforms points to its surge in popularity.

3/18/2024,Bitcoin Breaks Historical Trend with All-Time High Ahead of Halving,"According to Blockworks, Bitcoin has broken its historical trend by reaching an all-time high ahead of its upcoming halving. Historically, every Bitcoin halving has come a year or two before a new all-time high. This is partly because a halving reduces the block reward paid to miners, making Bitcoin more scarce. The three previous Bitcoin halvings occurred in the run-up to an all-time high, which then gave way to a price drawdown until the next halving helped ignite another rally. For the first time in its history, Bitcoin set an all-time price high in the immediate run-up to the halving when it topped $70,000 this month. Blockworks examined how Bitcoin's price responded to prior halvings. The first halving in November 2012 saw Bitcoin's price jump from around $12 to $229 by April 2013, and then to roughly $1,132 by November 2013. After the second halving in July 2016, Bitcoin's price gradually rose for a few months before picking up momentum in May 2017, hitting a new high of roughly $19,188 in December 2017. By the third halving in May 2020, Bitcoin's price rose from around $8,500 to over $40,000 by January 2021, and then topped $63,000 in April before peaking above $67,000 in November 2021. With the next halving in April 2024, it remains to be seen whether the trend of price runs following halvings will continue, as the circumstances are noticeably different this time around. Bitcoin's ongoing bull run to an all-time high above $73,000 is uncharted territory for halvings, which previously came with Bitcoin's price far below its prior peak."
3/18/2024,Bitcoin Searches Surpass Taylor Swift and Beyoncé on Google Trends,"According to Bloomberg, Bitcoin's record-breaking rally has led to a surge in searches for the largest cryptocurrency, surpassing the combined search volume for music artists Taylor Swift and Beyoncé over the last week, as per Google Trends data. During the Super Bowl weekend in early February, searches for Swift were 14 times higher than those for Bitcoin. However, a March spike in search interest for the digital asset has quickly reversed that relationship, with Bitcoin seeing an average search rating of 53 in the last week, compared to Swift and Beyoncé, who had average search ratings of 38 and nine, respectively. Google Trends data does not display raw search numbers but uses an index from zero to 100 to show relative search popularity. A series of market setbacks and high-profile criminal cases have hurt retail interest in Bitcoin over recent years, mirroring some of the anxiety that Swift writes about in her 'Anti-Hero' song from late 2022. Despite the token setting a new all-time high for five of the last seven days, search interest has still not hit the highs it saw back in 2021, when it reached its previous high. Nevertheless, the collection of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds has seen nearly $12 billion of net inflows since their launch. Bitcoin was lower by 2.7%, after setting an all-time high of $73,797 on Thursday."

His data shows that BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) sees an average of 250,000 trades per day. BlackRock declined to comment, but a person familiar with the matter confirmed that most of the money appears to be driven by retail investors. ETF issuers have also confirmed to Balchunas that demand is primarily driven by the retail crowd. VanEck's director of digital assets products, Kyle DaCruz, agreed that retail investors are a significant factor in the demand for their VanEck Bitcoin Trust (HODL), which launched in January alongside nine other spot bitcoin ETFs. ETFs make it easier for individual investors to allocate money into bitcoin without holding the actual asset themselves, allowing non-crypto investors to easily invest in the cryptocurrency through financial advisers or brokerage accounts. BlackRock's IBIT has attracted over $14 billion in assets in just two months, making it the most successful among the bitcoin ETFs."

3/20/2024,Grayscale Predicts Shift from US Government Bonds to Bitcoin as Macro Asset,"According to Foresight News, Grayscale has expressed on platform X that if the federal debt stock significantly increases in the coming years, overseas investors may lose interest in US government bonds. They may begin to shift from the US dollar to other currencies, such as Bitcoin. Bitcoin can be considered a macro asset, an alternative currency system, and a 'store of value' competing with the US dollar. Grayscale believes that the potential decrease in interest for US government bonds could lead to investors seeking alternative assets like Bitcoin. As a macro asset, Bitcoin offers a different currency system and store of value that could attract investors looking for options outside of the traditional US dollar-backed investments."
3/20/2024,"Over $533 Million in Crypto Long-Term Contracts Liquidated as BTC Falls Below $63,000","According to PANews, approximately $533 million worth of crypto long-term contracts were liquidated as Bitcoin ( ) fell below the $63,000 level. Since reaching its all-time high (ATH) of $73,800, BTC's fate has changed, with the digital asset now showing a bearish trend. In the past 24 hours, BTC continued its recent decline, with its price falling by more than 7%. For the first time in weeks, BTC dropped to the $62,600 level, meaning that its decline has exceeded 15% since its ATH. Although 's performance in the past day was not good, the average performance of other assets in the industry was even worse, with some assets experiencing double-digit losses. Due to these fluctuations, the derivatives market also experienced turbulence, with liquidations piling up on various exchanges. A contract is said to be ""liquidated"" when its accumulated losses reach a certain level, causing its open platform to intervene and forcibly close the contract. According to CoinGlass data, several such liquidations occurred in the crypto asset field within the past 24 hours. It appears that nearly $657 million worth of crypto asset derivative contracts were liquidated during this time. Given today's market price trend is heavily biased towards the downside, it is not surprising that the majority of liquidations involved long-term contracts. More specifically, the long market experienced $533 million in liquidations, while the short market suffered a $123 million hit. Over 80% of liquidations involved those who bet on 's rise. In terms of single liquidation amounts, BTC and Ethereum ( ) once again topped the list, with liquidation amounts of $191 million and $134 million, respectively. Among other assets, Solana and Dogecoin stood out with liquidation amounts of $39 million and $14 million, respectively. The large-scale liquidation of these assets may be partly due to their larger declines compared to other well-known assets. Despite the large amount of liquidations, 's open interest remains at relatively extreme levels. Open interest measures the total number of contracts related to BTC in the derivatives market. Generally, when this indicator is high, BTC is more prone to fluctuations, so the sharp price swings may continue until the indicator cools down further."

3/20/2024,Altcoins Enter Mid-Term Opportunity Zone Amid Bitcoin Price Correction,"According to CryptoPotato, Bitcoin's recent dip to $60.8K raised concerns about the sustainability of the rally, marking the largest single-day decline in two weeks. This downturn was accompanied by a decrease in inflows of spot Bitcoin ETFs and affected several altcoins as well. Despite the price correction, bullish sentiment remains strong, supported by Santiment's MVRV Opportunity & Danger Zone Model, which indicates a shift in altcoins' trajectory. The blockchain intelligence platform found that several altcoins now reside in the opportunity zone for mid-term trading. This zone activates when an asset's 30-day, 90-day, and 365-day average wallet returns collectively dip into negative territory. Market players are currently eyeing this moment to buy the dip while targeting assets experiencing maximum pain. Promising contenders in this zone currently include BOUNCE, Lido DAO ( ), OMG Network (OMG), (STORJ), and Synthetix Network ( ), presenting ripe opportunities amidst the market's fluctuations. Further analysis revealed that these five altcoins have entered the mathematical mid-term opportunity zone. Santiment's tweet stated that several altcoins have finally dropped enough for mid-term trading returns to be in an opportunity zone. Popular crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe also reiterated his bullish stance on altcoins, saying that several of them are having a healthy correction before a new expansion."

3/20/2024,Bitcoin Price Correction Accelerates as Spot ETFs Witness Outflows,"According to CoinDesk, Bitcoin's ( ) price correction intensified on Tuesday as U.S.-listed spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) experienced outflows. The leading cryptocurrency's value dropped over 8% to below $62,000, marking the largest single-day percentage decline since November 9, 2022. Several factors contributed to the price drop, including outflows from spot ETFs, as noted by trader and economist Alex Kruger. Investment firm Farside's provisional data revealed a net outflow of $326 million from spot ETFs on Tuesday, the largest on record. Grayscale's ETF saw a record outflow of $643 million on Monday.

3/20/2024,Bitcoin Blockchain Sees Surge in Computing Power Ahead of Halving Event,"According to CoinDesk, the Bitcoin blockchain has experienced a recent surge in computing power, speeding up the creation of new blocks as mining companies seek to capitalize on bullish market trends. Miners are bringing new, more powerful rigs online and even plugging in older machines again, pushing up the network computational power known as the 'hashrate.' A similar dynamic played out four years ago in the months before the last halving, which came earlier than expected. The crypto world is eagerly awaiting next month's bitcoin 'halving' – the once-every-four-years event when the reward for adding new data blocks to the network is reduced by 50%. It's a natural, pre-programmed part of the blockchain's underlying code. The halving is currently looking likely to fall around April 15, according to Nicehash's countdown. Just a few months ago, it was supposed to come on April 28. A similar phenomenon was observed in the run-up to the last halving four years ago, and history appears to be repeating itself. The halving is considered a momentous event by many, seen as a catalyst for bull runs in the bitcoin ( ) price and certainly a talking point in this year's runup to an all-time high just over $69,000. As the theory goes, if fewer new bitcoins are being created and demand keeps surging, they're harder to come by, so the value of those already in existence increases. April's halving will see the block reward reduce to 3.125 BTC from 6.25 BTC. But there's another dynamic playing out in the bitcoin market: As the price of the cryptocurrency rises, the rewards of mining it get richer, and more operators are encouraged to turn on their machines or ramp up their computational power, known as 'hashrate.' A recent surge in hashrate has sped up the creation of new blocks as mining companies seek to cash in, and they've pushed even harder by bringing newer, more powerful equipment online. Not so long ago, the Bitcoin mining-machine maker Antminer's S19s were all the rage. Now the S21s are the top of the line."

3/21/2024,Bitcoin Price Pullback: Analyzing Support Levels and Market Sentiment,"According to CryptoPotato, Bitcoin's price has recently experienced a pullback below the $70K level, leaving market participants wondering whether the top is in or not. However, there are still several support levels available to hold the market from further decline. On the daily chart, the price has been rallying consistently since rebounding from the $40K level, but the market has recently retreated from the $75K resistance level. The $67K – $69K level is currently being tested, and if the market breaks back above, a bullish continuation would be probable. However, a rejection can lead to a drop toward the $60K and possibly lower. Looking at the 4-hour timeframe, the price has been declining inside a descending channel. Yet, the market has finally broken the higher boundary of the channel and is currently testing the $67K – $69K zone. If the level breaks, a rise toward the previous high of around $74K and beyond would be imminent. Meanwhile, if the price drops back inside the channel, things might go ugly as it would indicate a fake breakout and result in a drop back to the $60K level in the short term. Bitcoin's price has recently experienced a pullback, dropping below the $70K mark. Analyzing whether this correction has caused the futures market to cool down would be beneficial for investors. Bitcoin funding rates, which measure whether the buyers or sellers are executing their orders more aggressively, have been experiencing a drop recently. This has led to a decline in funding rates, indicating that the futures market has cooled down. This can be a good sign, as it reduces further liquidations and can lead to a sustainable uptrend."
3/21/2024,"Bitcoin Non-Zero Wallet Addresses Drop, Indicating Potential Positive Returns","According to CryptoPotato, Bitcoin and the rest of the crypto market have recovered, wiping out most of the losses incurred during the recent correction. The leading asset could see more positive returns in the near future, according to the latest data. Santiment's recent analysis of Bitcoin's network activity revealed a notable decline in the number of total non-zero coin wallets over the past 10 days, with a net difference of -311K. The blockchain intelligence platform said that historically, such declines have coincided with moments of FUD in the market. During these periods, small wallets capitulate while larger addresses accumulate more. Taking into account these past occurrences, during similar drops in active wallets, Bitcoin has demonstrated significant price surges. For instance, from September 23rd to October 23rd, despite a decrease of 1.10 million non-zero wallets, BTC soared by 28%. Similarly, from January 21st to February 13th, with a decline of 757K non-zero wallets, BTC surged by 24%, Santiment observed. Therefore, despite the recent decrease in non-zero wallets, history suggests that Bitcoin may soon rebound with positive returns as traders exit the market, believing the top has been reached. Bitcoin saw a significant sell-off leading up to the correction that triggered a fall close to $62,000. While the crypto asset is still down nearly 10% from its recently established all-time high of $73,750, there's a renewed risk appetite among investors, particularly after the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on March 20, as noted by QCP Capital. Besides Bitcoin, altcoins such as Dogecoin, Solana, and Ethereum also recorded significant gains over the past 24 hours, with 13.35%, 9.09%, and 6.07%, respectively."

3/22/2024,Significant Changes in Crypto Market as BTC and ETH Options Set to Expire,"According to PANews, Greeks.live macro researcher Adam stated on the X platform that the crypto market has experienced significant changes this week, with 25,000 options and 250,000 options set to expire.

The Put Call Ratio for BTC options is 0.56, with the maximum pain point at $67,000, while the Put Call Ratio for ETH options is 0.51, with the maximum pain point at $3,500. The market rebound over the weekend could not be sustained, as Bitcoin's price failed to maintain above $70,000, resulting in a stalled uptrend and a deep market correction. At the same time, the demand for Put options surged, with implied volatility rising significantly for major maturities. However, the volume of Put positions settled has declined, indicating that a large number of Puts have been closed for profit, and the market's fear of missing out (FOMO) sentiment has significantly decreased."

3/22/2024,JPMorgan Warns Bitcoin Remains Overbought Despite Recent Correction,"According to CoinDesk, JPMorgan has stated that bitcoin remains overbought, even after the recent sharp correction in the cryptocurrency market. The price of bitcoin fell by over 15% before rebounding following the Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Wednesday. In a research report, the bank noted that there is still considerable optimism in the market for prices to rise significantly by year-end, with a significant component of that optimism arising from the view that bitcoin demand via spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) would continue at the same pace even as the supply of bitcoin diminishes after the halving event. The quadrennial reward halving, when miners' rewards are cut in half, is expected to occur in mid-April. However, JPMorgan observed that the pace of net inflows into spot bitcoin ETFs has slowed considerably, with a significant outflow recorded in the past week. This challenges the notion that the spot bitcoin ETF picture will be characterized as a sustained one-way net inflow. The report suggests that profit-taking is more likely to continue as the halving event approaches, particularly against a positioning backdrop that still looks overbought despite the past week's correction."

3/22/2024,"Bitcoin's Next Halving Event Expected in April, Exact Date Unknown","According to Blockworks, Bitcoin's next halving event is anticipated to take place in the second half of April, but the exact date remains uncertain. Block reward halvings reduce the supply of new bitcoin by 50% and are considered catalysts for price growth and a foundation for 's perceived four-year market cycles. Halvings do not affect the overall difficulty of bitcoin mining, but they do reduce the reward, effectively doubling the cost of bitcoin production. The specific time and date for halvings are impossible to pinpoint due to the random nature of bitcoin mining. Satoshi Nakamoto designed Bitcoin's issuance to be cut in half every 210,000 blocks, with protocols ensuring blocks are found every 10 minutes on average. It takes approximately 2.1 million minutes to mine 210,000 blocks, which translates to around four years. Miners use specialized machines, application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), capable of producing trillions of hashes per second. The rate of block discovery is influenced by the global block difficulty, which is adjusted every 2,016 blocks. The difficulty is increased or decreased based on the time it took to discover the previous 2,016 blocks. Due to the stochastic process of finding blocks and the unpredictable nature of block production, it is not feasible to know when the next block or halving will occur. However, the upcoming halving event is expected to happen soon, and its impact on the market will be closely monitored."

3/25/2024,Bitcoin ETFs Could Mitigate 2024 BTC Halving Price Retracement,"According to Cointelegraph: The upcoming Bitcoin halving in 2024 could present a promising bull-run scenario as the event historically leads to some retracement in the token's price. This time around, experts are considering whether the presence of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which could attract substantial institutional investments, might soften the downturn generally associated with halving events. Bitcoin held by funds over the last six months. Source: ByteTree Bitcoin's halving event, occurring every four years or every 210,000 blocks, reduces the supply of new BTC, maintaining the currency's intrinsic scarcity. Crypto analysis firm Rekt Capital suggests the halving process comprises five stages—pre-halving downside, pre-halving rally, pre-halving retracement, reaccumulation, and parabolic uptrend. Currently, market watchers believe Bitcoin has entered the third stage, a pre-halving retracement, where downward price movement is common as investors anticipate sell pressure and exit their positions. Bitcoin ETFs are expected to play a key role in this stage. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved 11 Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024, a decision that expanded the exposure of the flagship digital currency to more traditional investors. On March 5, Bitcoin ETF products reached a cumulative $10 billion in trading volume, revealing a substantial demand which could counteract the price drop during the third and fourth halving stages. However, some experts argue that while Bitcoin ETF inflows could balance against the sell-off pressure, they could also amplify the effect if the demand for Bitcoin ETFs declines. As it stands, the performance of Bitcoin ETFs makes a bearish outcome seem less likely, but only time will determine the extent of saturation Bitcoin ETFs can attain in future halving stages."

ETNs are unsecured debt securities typically issued by banks, exposing investors to the credit risk of the issuing institution. Unlike Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), ETNs do not actually correspond to a portfolio of securities; their returns are based solely on the change in value of a predetermined index. This means that ETNs do not need to track an index by buying and selling securities."

Despite underperforming in recent months, investors can remain optimistic due to significant support levels. Technical analysis by TradingRage shows that against USDT, the price has been steadily declining since failing to break through the $0.7 resistance level. However, support has been found around $0.6, preventing further drops. If this mark fails, there's potential for a turnaround near the 200-day moving average, situated around $0.57, offering another possible support level for XRP. A rebound from this level could lead to a potential rise toward $0.7. Examining the Bitcoin pair, there's been a prolonged downward trend in the market. Currently, the XRP price is revisiting the 900 SAT support area. A successful bounce from this level could prompt an attempt to breach the long-standing bearish trendline. If this occurs, the next objective would likely be the 1200 SAT resistance level. Conversely, a failure to hold above the 900 SAT support zone could have dire consequences, potentially triggering a substantial downturn in the market."
3/25/2024,Bitcoin Breaks $70K Mark as Crypto Market Resurgence Continues,"According to CoinDesk: Bitcoin has rebounded strongly, breaking the $70,000 barrier for the first time in ten days, as the broader cryptocurrency market exhibits a wave of bullish momentum. This recent rally didn’t trigger widespread short liquidations, indicating a lack of market participants leveraging bets on price dips. The cryptocurrency market has started the week robustly, moving past its recent corrective phase. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading close to its 2021 peak prices. As part of the resurgence, Bitcoin surged over 7% in the past 24 hours. Ether (ETH) similarly rose by 6% during the same timeframe. Significant layer-1 network tokens, such as Solana (SOL) and Avalanche (AVAX), progressed by over 10%. The rally was broad-based, extending to nearly all digital assets, with all components of the CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20) in the green, and the index improving by 6.1% on the day. BTC liquidations (CoinGlass) This sudden upswing liquidated around $195 million of leveraged derivatives positions across all cryptocurrency assets. Of these, approximately $129 million were short positions that were betting on prices falling, according to CoinGlass data. Liquidations of Bitcoin short positions amounted to $53 million, which is less than the recent average daily figure. In the context of higher Bitcoin prices, the below-average level of short liquidations suggests a lack of market participants leveraging bets on continued price weakness. This resilience could indicate a strong underlying market sentiment, strengthening the ongoing recovery and crypto rally."

Notwithstanding prior negative spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) flows, could this hint at a new all-time high? There are three key reasons behind the recent surge in Bitcoin. BTC/USD daily chart. Source: TradingView 1. Negation of Last Week's Negative ETF flows: Following a record period of inflows, investors withdrew more than $942 million last week, culminating in the first negative flow into crypto investment products. This sentiment was primarily centred on Bitcoin, accounting for 96% of these outflows. CoinShares attributes this to a drawdown in crypto prices. Despite this, Bitcoin managed to bounce back. 2. Spike in Bitcoin ""Age Consumed"" Metric: Bitcoin's Age Consumed metric, that tracks the movement of previously idle BTC coins, has seen a significant surge; with dormant BTC addresses moving BTC surging to its highest in over two years.

3/25/2024,Core Scientific CEO Discusses Preparing for Bitcoin Halving and Updating Mining Equipment,"According to Foresight News, Core Scientific CEO Adam Sullivan has stated that the company is adjusting its balance sheet to update its mining equipment in preparation for potential purchases after the Bitcoin halving event. He anticipates that the halving will put financial pressure on some companies in the industry. Sullivan's comments highlight the importance of staying up-to-date with the latest mining technology and being prepared for market changes. The upcoming Bitcoin halving event is expected to have a significant impact on the mining industry, as it will reduce the rewards for mining new blocks by 50%. This could lead to increased competition and financial strain for some companies, making it crucial for businesses like Core Scientific to be prepared and have a solid strategy in place.

3/25/2024,Trading Bitcoin's Halving: Expert Advice from Three Traders,"According to Cointelegraph: With eyes on the horizon for Bitcoin's upcoming halving, traders are striving to navigate the crypto market's unpredictable landscape. Bitcoin recently threw investors for a loop, dropping from $69,000 to $60,800 - approximating an 18% decline from this month's historic high of $73,800. This decrease was powered, in part, by outflows from 11 newly minted Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which shed a total of $836 million in funding between March 18-21, per data compiled by Farside Investors. Speculation mounts on whether new investors are having second thoughts and whether they are likely to hold onto Bitcoin if the downward momentum persists. Three investors were approached for insights and trading advice in today's market environment. Firstly, Lucas Kiely, Chief Investment Officer for Yield App, pointed out that since the ETFs' inception, Bitcoin has been mimicking equity markets. Kiely recommends taking advantage of liquidity surges during specific times of the day when price action is practically inevitable. However, note that outside these time windows, liquidity decreases, and price fluctuations can become severe. Michael van de Poppe, CEO and founder of MN Trading Consultancy, attributes the recent ETF investment decline partly to the most recent Federal Reserve meeting and the Bank of Japan's decision to raise interest rates. His advice would be to buy Bitcoin dips when the price is relatively low. Lastly, Chris Newhouse, a DeFi analyst at Cumberland Labs, advises today’s buyers to be cautious: distinguish between FOMO-led purchasing and long-term demand. Newhouse favors placing ""stink bids"" during weeks featuring ""wicky"" price action. The market is set to buy dips currently, but he cautions that major headwinds would be necessary for a more significant pullback. It's key to remember that, in the face of imminent halving and the volatile nature of the current market, all trading involves risk and should be undertaken with due diligence."

Several altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin, with nearing $190, while NEAR and have soared by double digits. Last week, Bitcoin experienced a price drop on Monday, followed by a further drop below $61,000 on Tuesday amid fears of the upcoming US FOMC meeting. However, after the Fed maintained its current monetary policy, Bitcoin soared by about seven thousand dollars in the next day or so. Despite this, the cryptocurrency started losing ground on Thursday and Friday, culminating in a price drop to $62,500. Over the weekend, a recovery attempt was halted at $66,000, but the cryptocurrency started gaining traction again this morning, soaring to $67,500 for the first time in days. As of now, Bitcoin's value has decreased slightly and sits just below $67,000. Its market cap has reclaimed the $1.3 trillion level, and its dominance over altcoins is up slightly to 49.3%.

3/25/2024,Understanding the Implications of Bitcoin's 2024 Halving: Price Volatility and Network Security,"According to Cointelegraph: As the cryptocurrency world anticipates the Bitcoin halving slated for April 2024, the spotlight is on the potential implications, particularly for Bitcoin's price and network security. In this event, the reward for mining Bitcoin will be slashed by 50% in an anti-inflationary measure known as “the halving.” Historical contexts of Bitcoin halvings highlight substantial surges in its price post-halving. For instance: 1. First Halving (Nov 28, 2012): The initial reward of 50 BTC per block was cut to 25 BTC. Bitcoin's price then shot up from $12.20 to around $1,000 by the end of 2023. 2. Second Halving (July 9, 2016): The mining reward reduced to 12.5 BTC per block. Bitcoin's price rose from $640 to $2,550 within a year. 3. Third Halving (May 11, 2020): Mining rewards decreased to 6.25 BTC/block. Within a year, Bitcoin reached an all-time high of about $62,000. According to this trend, Bitcoin prices have typically surged within a year post-halving, though some recessions have been recorded within that timeframe. Given this background, diverse predictions are flying around for the 2024 post-halving price, ranging from around $75,000 shortly after the event to over $250,000 within a year of the halving. Security concerns related to the upcoming Bitcoin halving stem from the potential risk to minor miners, who could be forced out due to reduced rewards. This could transiently impact the Bitcoin network by reducing hash rates and undermining overall security. However, previous halvings have exhibited marginal effects on network security, with many analysts expecting a relatively seamless transaction come 2024."

3/25/2024,Bitcoin ETFs Experience Unprecedented Five-Day Net Outflow Streak,"According to Blockworks: US bitcoin ETFs witnessed an unusual wave of net outflows each day over the previous week. The 10 spot bitcoin ETFs saw $888 million leave across five days, as per BitMEX Research data, marking a first for the so far successful arena. This outflow was notably large on March 19 and 20, reporting $326 million and $262 million, respectively. Although net outflows slowed towards the latter part of the week, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) recorded its lowest ever daily flow total of $19 million on Friday. Despite the outflow, both the IBIT and the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin ETF have notably registered net inflows for each of their first 50 days trading - a record among new ETFs. This outflow run comes hot on the heels of a historical week for the funds, wherein they recorded $2.5 billion in net inflows. However, during the same period, Bitcoin's price plunged by over 10% from nearly $68,000 on March 18 to less than $61,000. Weighing in on the matter, James Butterfill, Head of Research at CoinShares, suggested that the recent price correction likely caused investor hesitation, resulting in lower inflows into new ETF issuers in the US. Focusing on Grayscale Investments, which converted its Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) to an ETF on January 11, outflows there reached about $2 billion. These outflows were not entirely offset by the other nine funds, which collectively accounted for approximately $1.1 billion net inflows. Meanwhile, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart suggested that these outflows may have been partly stimulated by bankrupt lender Genesis selling its GBTC shares. He added that this activity is expected to slow in the coming week."

The total value of the expiring options exceeds $15 billion, making it the largest quarterly settlement in both proportion and value. The massive scale of this settlement will result in the release of a significant amount of margin, which could impact the current market structure. This event highlights the growing importance of options in the cryptocurrency market and may lead to increased volatility in the short term."
3/26/2024,Spot BTC ETFs See Positive Net Aggregate Flow for First Time Since March 15,"According to CryptoPotato, the net aggregate of funds to the newly launched batch of spot ETFs turned positive for the first time since March 15, with a net inflow of $15.4 million on March 25. This reverses a trend that resulted in net outflows of $887 million over the past week. Although the inflow figure is the lowest since January 26, it marks a trend reversal as Bitcoin prices recover following their pre-halving retrace. Preliminary data from Farside Investors reports that Grayscale’s GBTC saw a $350 million outflow on March 25. Contrary to analyst predictions, GBTC outflows have not slowed down and continue to impact overall aggregate ETF flow figures. Grayscale has lost 273,335 BTC since its GBTC fund was converted to a spot ETF in mid-January. Assets under management for the remaining 347,552 BTC in the fund are currently $24.7 billion. Today’s figures have been boosted by Fidelity, which has had a $262 million inflow for its FBTC fund, which has an AUM total of $7.2 billion. BlackRock, which has been leading the pack so far, only managed an inflow of $35.5 million – way below its average. Its IBIT fund has an AUM figure of $13.4 billion, so the two together still don’t match what Grayscale holds. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas reported that BlackRock and Fidelity have had 50 straight days of inflows, which is “unheard of for a new ETF.” The ETF flow trend change comes as Bitcoin prices surged to $71,000 in late trading on March 25. The asset had held gains and was trading at $70,641 at the time of writing during the Tuesday morning Asian trading session. Approval odds for spot Ethereum ETFs have been tweaked again by those in the know. “We are holding the line at 25% odds, although it is a very pessimistic 25%,” said Balchunas on March 26. “The lack of engagement seems to be purposeful vs procrastination. No positive signs/intel anywhere you look. Personally hope they do approve it but it just ain’t looking good.” Meanwhile, Grayscale chief legal officer Craig Salm said he was not deterred “and believe the ETFs should be approved” before explaining: “I don’t think perceived lack of engagement from regulators should be indicative of one outcome or another. All of these issues were figured out and are identical when comparing spot to ETFs.”"

3/26/2024,Bitcoin ETF Approval Accelerates Crypto Adoption Amid Rising US Debt and Halving Event,"According to Blockworks, Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz believes that the approval of a bitcoin ETF is just the beginning of accelerated crypto adoption, especially as the US debt level rises and the Bitcoin halving approaches. Despite regulatory challenges, Novogratz highlighted the US's national debt of over $34 trillion, which has increased by around $1 trillion in recent 100-day periods. He stated that until the US and other countries get their finances in order, the story for bitcoin and other digital assets will continue to grow. Bitcoin, which has a finite supply, has historically acted as a hedge against currency debasement. Its price rose above $71,000 on Tuesday morning. Novogratz added that the crypto story is powerful right now, and with the bitcoin ETF, they have opened up the $80 trillion baby boomer giant bulk of wealth in the United States. Galaxy launched a spot bitcoin ETF with Invesco in January, and the Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF (BTCO) was one of 10 such US products to launch at that time. The segment has so far attracted about $11.3 billion of net inflows. Easier access to bitcoin via the ETF is set to coincide with the bitcoin halving next month, when per-block mining rewards will drop from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC. Novogratz noted that this event creates a good supply-demand imbalance. While the Securities and Exchange Commission's approval of bitcoin ETFs legitimized the asset for a new segment of investors, the rest of the crypto space is still facing regulatory challenges. The SEC is set to rule on spot ether ETFs in May, but many industry watchers are bearish on the possibility of those getting cleared to trade. Novogratz said that until there is a change in SEC leadership, the firm can be hopeful but not optimistic about getting cleared to become a US public company."

NUPL indicator. Source: CryptoQuant The head of research at CryptoQuant, Julio Moreno, explained that unrealized profits from Bitcoin's recent rally are increasing selling pressure. A possible slowdown of inflows to spot Bitcoin ETFs in the future could exacerbate this pressure on Bitcoin prices. Miners cost production per Bitcoin post-halving. Source: CoinShares. The net unrealized profit and loss (NUPL) indicator from CryptoQuant aligns with this analysis. An indicator warning sign of 0.7 suggests investors might be ready to cash in on profits, which would further drive down prices and amplify selling pressure. Even with recent BTC price corrections, the NUPL indicator had climbed to 0.606 on March 17. The Bitcoin ETFs witnessed one of their lowest influx of new investment days on March 14, recording a mere $132 million in net activity. Although industry insiders predict further interest in these ETFs as brokerage firms hasten their due diligence for offering Bitcoin ETFs to clients, the impact of declining inflows cannot be overlooked. Meanwhile, miners are selling more reserves before the halving to maximize profits, with the event reducing the reward for mining new blocks by 50%.

However, the severity of this potential bearish market could be softened due to institutional investors' portfolio rebalancing strategies, which may help mitigate volatility."

3/26/2024,Nearly $900 Million Withdrawn From Bitcoin ETFs Amid Market Dip,"According to Bloomberg, almost $900 million was withdrawn from Bitcoin ETFs last week, reflecting continuous outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust and a moderation in subscriptions for other offerings. Despite the slowdown in ETF inflows, order books are loaded on the bid side around the 60k area, indicating that the market is eager to buy the dip, according to Nathanaël Cohen, co-founder at digital-asset hedge fund INDIGO Fund. He added that liquidity needs to be obtained at lower levels to catch a bid and generate momentum to go higher. The new demand from Bitcoin ETFs has been a major driving force behind the historic rally in the largest cryptocurrency this year. Strong inflows into the funds sparked optimism around exponential growth of the asset class from a wider range of investors. However, the significant outflows last week have raised concerns about the sustainability of the rally. Shares of crypto-related companies also experienced a jump."

3/26/2024,Bitcoin Expected to Surge Significantly by End of This Week,"According to BlockBeats, 10x Research has released a summary of its weekly market analysis report on March 26th. The report states that the three reversal indicators monitored by 10x Research remain bullish and are expected to continue. As a result, Bitcoin is predicted to experience a significant increase by the end of this quarter, which is within this week. However, investors should still be cautious about the key level of $68,000, which should not be broken. Markus Thielen, the founder of 10x Research, said yesterday that if Bitcoin can hold steady at $68,330, a technical head and shoulders bottom pattern will form. This would lead Bitcoin to directly target the next historical high of $83,000 and even potentially break through the $100,000 mark."

3/27/2024,Bitcoin Halving Set to Continue Until 2140: What to Expect,"According to Blockworks, the Bitcoin network experiences a halving of supply approximately every four years, with the next halving set to occur in 2140. Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin's pseudonymous creator, programmed the year 2140 as the time when block rewards would drop to less than one satoshi, the smallest unit of bitcoin. The halving is modeled after the physical mining of scarce resources, according to Jameson Lopp, co-founder and chief security officer at Casa. He notes that Nakamoto explained the supply schedule to Mike Hearn, a former Google engineer who became an early Bitcoin contributor, in 2009. Satoshi chose 21 million as the number of coins and distribution schedule, but the divisibility of a bitcoin could be represented differently depending on its value. As the rate of issuance declines for 132 years, transaction fees will become more important for maintaining the network's hashrate and security. Lopp is optimistic about the future of the multi-layered Bitcoin ecosystem, expecting on-chain transactions to pay relatively high fees as the base chain starts to resemble a high-value cryptographic accumulator."
3/27/2024,Bitcoin Nears Two-Week Highs as Sell Orders are Cleared Amid Volatility,"According to Cointelegraph: Bitcoin (BTC) witnessed fresh volatility at the Wall Street open on March 27, hitting its peak levels in nearly two weeks — $71,754 on Bitstamp.

3/27/2024,"BTC Supply Squeeze Looms as Sell-side Liquidity Crisis Emerges, Stirring Dormant Coins","According to Cointelegraph: Bitcoin (BTC) appears to be on the brink of a supply squeeze unlike any seen before, with only about a year before demand surpasses supply, according to the latest research. In its ""Weekly Crypto Report"" on March 26, on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant discussed an impending ""sell-side liquidity crisis."" The report states, ""Record Bitcoin demand paired with declining sell-side liquidity has resulted in the liquid inventory of Bitcoin plunging to the lowest ever in terms of months of demand."" The explosive demand for Bitcoin this year is largely fueled by the United States' spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and supply dynamics could entirely change by Q1 2025. CryptoQuant estimates that at the current demand growth rate, the present sell-side liquidity inventory will only suffice for the next twelve months. Notably, only accumulating addresses —those with no outgoing transactions— were included in these calculations, suggesting the actual demand might be even higher. In the analysis of Bitcoin supply strictly available on U.S. exchanges, the supply can meet demand for merely six months. Meanwhile, the liquidity crisis seems to be ""waking up"" old supply. Ki Young Ju, CryptoQuant's CEO, reported on coins mined in 2010, which remained dormant until recently, making a move to a newly created wallet address. Even so, the overall trend shows Bitcoin's available supply gradually lessening, hinting at potential supply-demand imbalances in the future, which could have significant implications on BTC's market price.

3/27/2024,Bitcoin Could Witness Substantial Surge as Short Sellers Face Pressure,"According to CryptoPotato, recent projections from crypto analysts suggest that Bitcoin ( ) could experience a significant surge, while short sellers may face considerable pressure. Analysts from the Kobeissi Letter believe that the substantial gap between institutional long positions and hedge fund shorts could lead to a massive short squeeze. Institutions are holding nearly 20,000 net long contracts compared to hedge funds' approximately 15,000 net short contracts. This margin could be the main catalyst for the BTC short squeeze, according to Kobeissi. Continued upward pressure on Bitcoin's price could force short sellers to cover their positions, further fueling the bullish momentum. A popular pseudonymous trader known as Dave the Wave predicts that $160K for BTC could be rather conservative. Dave bases his analysis on his own version of logarithmic growth channels (LGC), which he uses to predict market cycle tops and bottoms while filtering out short-term fluctuations and highlighting overarching trends. According to his analysis, Bitcoin appears to be following a pattern reminiscent of 2020, characterized by a breakout from an ascending channel into a parabolic upward movement, resulting in a significant price surge of approximately 154%. At press time, Bitcoin had reclaimed the $70K level, a 14.2% recovery from last week. Interest from institutions and retail investors is growing again, which could mean more bullish momentum for BTC. This comes after last week's massive outflows that pushed the cryptocurrency's price south. The asset tumbled by more than twelve grand after its most recent ATH of $73,800 to a multi-week low of under $61,000. However, BTC now stands above $70,000, and the community wonders if there will be a new ATH before the April halving."

3/27/2024,Bitcoin Options Worth Over $9.4B Set to Expire on March 29,"According to Cointelegraph: Over 134,000 Bitcoin (BTC) options with a collective worth exceeding $9.4 billion are due to expire on the Deribit cryptocurrency exchange on March 29. Some analysts have posited that the ""max pain"" price for Bitcoin could be in the vicinity of $50,000. The term ""max pain"" refers to the price point at which the maximum number of open Bitcoin options contracts (both puts and calls) would result in the most financial losses for the majority of option holders at the expiration time. Bitcoin may suffer a price correction to around $51,000 if inflows into the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) decrease. This suggestion comes from Ki Young Ju, the founder, and CEO of CryptoQuant, who stated, ""New whales, mainly ETF buyers, have a $56K on-chain cost basis. Corrections typically entail a max drawdown of around 30% in bull markets, with a max pain of $51K."" After five consecutive days of negative outflows last week, the U.S. Bitcoin ETFs witnessed over $15 million in net inflows on March 25. This is the same day that the Bitcoin price marked its highest daily close of over $69,000 in the last ten days. Collectively, the spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a net inflow of $418 million on March 26. According to analyst Rekt Capital, Bitcoin's pre-halving price correction has acted in accordance with previously seen retracements before the halving. If Bitcoin flips its old all-time high of $69,000 into a support level, the crypto asset could potentially trend towards new all-time highs."
3/27/2024,"Unknown Entity Consolidates 2,000 BTC Mined in 2010 into Single Wallet","According to CryptoPotato, an unknown individual or entity recently consolidated 2,000 mined in 2010 into a single wallet. The consolidation occurred on March 26, involving the transfer of 40 sets of mining rewards, each consisting of 50 BTC, into one wallet. At the time of mining, the rewards amounted to $600. Developer mononautical, who noted the consolidation, remarked, 'Imagine holding for 14 years as the value rockets from a few hundred dollars to $140 million.' Responding to the revelation, another user raised concerns about the possibility of compromised key generation, suggesting either a known pool or a random origin for the rewards. However, mononautical clarified that the miner remains unidentified, suggesting the transfer may have been a strategic move rather than a security breach. 'It’s possible the keys were compromised, but it seems like this went straight to an OTC desk,' mononautical added, citing a previous instance of similar old mining wallet sweeps. This news follows another significant Bitcoin movement over the weekend. The fifth richest Bitcoin address, which had remained dormant since 2019, suddenly sprung to life. According to blockchain analytics firm Arkham, in 2019, this address was funded with 94,500 worth $6.05 billion. The Bitcoin remained untouched until recently when it was divided and transferred to new addresses. CryptoQuant founder and CEO Ki Young Ju pointed out that the consolidation indicates a 'sell-side liquidity crisis waking up old Bitcoin.' Ju also suggested that the transaction pattern indicates over-the-counter (OTC) sales of the funds. Meanwhile, CryptoQuant’s latest 'Weekly Crypto Report' outlined an upcoming 'sell-side liquidity crisis.' The report attributed the crisis to a surge in Bitcoin demand, mainly fueled by the introduction of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. This heightened demand has drastically reduced the available supply for sale. According to the report, Bitcoin’s liquid inventory has reached its lowest level ever in terms of months of demand, with current supply only sufficient to cover demand growth for twelve months."
3/27/2024,"Bitcoin 'In the Midst of Bull Run', Says Grayscale Report","According to Cointelegraph: Grayscale, in a recent report, suggested that Bitcoin is currently in the ""middle of the bull run,"" backed by a combination of robust fundamental and technical factors. With Bitcoin's price typically peaking 8-11 months post-halving, it indicates the onset of crypto bull runs. Source: Grayscale Historically, a surge in Bitcoin's dominance has proved to be a precursor to a crypto bull run, leading to an increase in BTC price as investors venture into higher-risk cryptocurrencies. This pattern was evident during the 2021-2022 bull run where Bitcoin's gains swiftly followed a significant uptick in altcoin valuations. Three unique factors distinguish this Bitcoin cycle: spot Bitcoin ETF inflows, positive stablecoin inflows, and a decreasing BTC balance on exchanges. The report highlighted that since its approval on Jan. 10, spot Bitcoin ETF inflows have consistently surpassed BTC “issuance by a magnitude of more than 3 times,"" exerting an upward pressure on the price. Other key components of the ongoing Bitcoin rally were healthy on-chain fundamentals, including the supply of stablecoin on exchanges. The data revealed available capital for trading, usually to buy cryptocurrencies. In contrast, a lack of intent to sell, evidenced by a decreasing supply on exchanges, supports Bitcoin's rally. The report concludes that the current market is navigating the 'mid-phase' or the 'fifth inning' of the bull run. Despite subdued retail sentiments, Grayscale believes there is still room for a further run and advises its investors to cautiously monitor spot Bitcoin ETF flows and other macroeconomic factors for possible market shifts."

3/27/2024,"Bitcoin Mining More Profitable in February, Publicly Traded Miners Lose Market Share","According to CoinDesk, Bitcoin mining was more profitable in February than in January, as the cryptocurrency's price rose 15% while the network hashrate increased at a slower rate of 9%, according to a research report by investment bank Jefferies. Publicly listed North American mining companies produced a smaller share of bitcoin compared with the previous month, slipping to 17.5% of the total network from 19%, as new hashrate came online from other sources. The network hashrate has nearly doubled from a year ago, but publicly traded miners have lost market share, analysts Jonathan Petersen and Amanda Santillo wrote. Marathon Digital (MARA) had previously used third-party providers to host its machines rather than building its own infrastructure, but the company has changed strategy and is buying out some of the hosting services, a defensive move ahead of the halving, which Jefferies supports. The bank maintained its hold rating on Marathon Digital shares and cut its price target to $24 from $30. It increased its price target on hold-rated Argo Blockchain (ARBK) to $1.50 from $1.20 to reflect the higher bitcoin price. The bank said that with less capex dedicated to mining facility development, ARBK should have cash to buy additional miners and increase hashrate more quickly."
3/27/2024,"Bitcoin ETFs See Net Inflows of $417.98 Million, Grayscale Experiences Outflows","According to PANews, on-chain analyst Yu Jing reported that ten Bitcoin spot ETFs experienced a net inflow of funds amounting to $417.98 million on March 26th. It is estimated that after the US stock market opens on March 27th, the ETF custody addresses will see a net inflow of approximately 6,018 Bitcoins. Among them, Grayscale (GBTC) experienced a net outflow of about 3,058 Bitcoins, while the remaining nine ETFs had a combined net inflow of approximately 9,076 Bitcoins, mainly from Fidelity (FBTC) and BlackRock (IBIT), which together accounted for 6,354 Bitcoins. Currently, the ten Bitcoin spot ETFs hold a total of about 825,040 Bitcoins. The difference in Bitcoin holdings between BlackRock (IBIT) and Grayscale (GBTC) is now less than 100,000. According to the current trend, BlackRock's holdings may surpass Grayscale's in half a month."
3/27/2024,Macroeconomic and Regulatory Pressures Weaken Bitcoin as Prices Slip,"According to Cointelegraph: The Bitcoin price retracted at the $71,000 level amidst wavering confidence among professional traders. March 27 saw a moderate BTC correction to $68,430 after an unsuccessful attempt to surpass the $71,000 mark. Over the past week, Bitcoin derivatives data pointed to a decline in bullish sentiment, suggesting a break of key support at $69,000. Bitcoin's price displayed a notable rally from $63,800 to $70,000 leading up to March 27, despite only $151 million of leveraged short positions being forcibly closed on the BTC futures markets. This pattern implies skeptical bears, even after last week's considerable $888 million net withdrawal from U.S. Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Despite the pressures, Bitcoin proved resilient in its recovery from a 17.6% plunge from $73,757 on March 14 to $60,795 on March 20. Some believe the major driver for BTC reaching new heights before the upcoming April Bitcoin halving was the unexpected surge of inflows into spot ETFs. On a brighter note for Bitcoin enthusiasts, spot ETF flows saw an encouraging reversal this week, recording a total of $418 million in net inflows on March 26. Significantly, this wasn't due to reduced outflows from Grayscale's GBTC, suggesting genuine institutional demand amid Bitcoin's price lingering just 4% below its peak. Concerns related to global economic downtrends, uncertainty surrounding U.S. Federal Reserve's future interest rate decisions, and increasing regulatory pressures are among the factors contributing to the weakening of Bitcoin prices. The shift away from leveraged BTC long positions, for instance, is likely a reflection of the increasing apprehension about broader economic recession threats and external pressures, such as the U.S. Justice Department's charges against KuCoin exchange recently and discussions on crypto payment limitations by the European Parliament's committee."
3/27/2024,Hashdex Bitcoin Futures ETF Renamed to Hashdex Bitcoin ETF,"According to PANews, Tidal and Hashdex have announced the renaming of the Hashdex Bitcoin Futures ETF to Hashdex Bitcoin ETF, with the NYSE Arca trading code as DEFI.

It is expected that at least 95% of the assets will be invested in spot bitcoin, with the remaining 5% of assets available for investment in bitcoin futures contracts traded on CME, as well as cash and cash equivalents. Hashdex will serve as the DEFI digital asset advisor, with Tidal acting as the issuer. Tidal ETF Services LLC will act as the fund's manager, and BitGo will serve as the bitcoin custodian."
3/27/2024,Bitcoin Consolidation Triggers Concerns of a Sell-Side Liquidity Crisis,"According to Cointelegraph: An unidentified individual or entity has consolidated 2,000 Bitcoin (BTC), received as mining rewards back in 2010, into a single wallet. CryptoQuant founder and CEO Ki Young Ju stated that this movement suggests a ""sell-side liquidity crisis waking up old Bitcoin."" A sell-side liquidity crisis refers to a market condition where there's a shortage of available assets, causing sellers to struggle to find buyers or execute trades at desired prices. This may result in heightened volatility and price fluctuations. The 2,000 Bitcoin transfer, comprising 40 batches of mining rewards, each receiving 50 Bitcoin, was noticed by developer Mononautical on March 26. At the time these blocks were mined, their worth was around $600. Now, they amount to nearly $140 million. In addition to this, the weekend also saw the fifth-wealthiest Bitcoin address transferring $6 billion worth of Bitcoin to three distinct addresses, leaving only 1.4 BTC ($99,000) remaining in the original wallet. In other noteworthy movement, an individual transferred 26.9 BTC (worth $1.2 million at the time) from a Binance account to the Bitcoin network's genesis wallet, a non-retrievable location. Similarly, in July 2023, a dormant Bitcoin wallet containing over 1,037 BTC (worth $31 million at the time) woke after a slumber lasting 11 years and transferred out all its content."
3/27/2024,"Investors Increasingly Discussing Over 3% Allocation to Bitcoin, Says Bitwise CIO","According to BlockBeats, Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan stated on March 27 that discussions with professional investors about Bitcoin allocation have shifted from a 1% focus since 2018 to now discussing allocations of over 3%. Hougan pointed out that the newly launched US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) is the main reason for this change, as it reduces the downside risk of Bitcoin. If the possibility of 'going to zero' no longer exists, then a 3% or 5% allocation begins to seem more reasonable. Although true institutional investors, such as pension funds and endowments, will still focus on allocations below 1%, for the wealth market, allocations above 3% have become a new trend. Hougan also mentioned that since the launch of the ETF over two months ago, the total amount of funds flowing into the US spot Bitcoin ETF has reached approximately $11.7 billion, indicating a long-term sustained demand, which is expected to continue for several years."
3/27/2024,"South American Gold Miner Nilam Resources Acquires 24,800 Bitcoins with Xyberdata","According to PANews, South American gold mining company Nilam Resources announced its acquisition of an unestablished special purpose entity called MindWave, in partnership with Mauritius-based company Xyberdata. This acquisition will grant them access to 24,800 bitcoins. However, the announcement did not provide details on how they would obtain the billions of dollars' worth of cryptocurrency. The confusion surrounding the acquisition is exacerbated by the current financial status of both companies. Nilam Resources' company profile shows that its EBITDA is expected to be only $2 million. Xyberdata's unaudited financial statements show that its ""shareholder funds"" are about $70 million, with only $1.5 million in cash on hand. This is far from the price of the bitcoins they claim to acquire (approximately $1.2 billion), and it is unclear how the two companies will raise such funds. However, the press release does indicate that Nilam will issue new Class C shares in this transaction. When media contacted Nilam Resources executive Ron McIntyre to inquire about the bitcoin acquisition, they were informed that he had resigned as CEO and had his name removed from all company documents. When asked why he resigned, McIntyre said, ""Just look at the chart - it's a classic pump and dump."" He added, ""The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) will investigate Nilam Resources."" McIntyre stated that although his colleagues ""said a transaction was imminent,"" they never provided him with the details of the transaction and released the press release without allowing him to review it or even informing him of the announcement."

However, not all agree on this prediction. Since September, Cowen claims Bitcoin’s market cap dominance has been in an ascending triangle pattern. Source: Benjamin Cowen Crypto trader and Into The Cryptoverse founder, Benjamin Cowen, stated that the ""BTC dominance train is about to leave the station,"" indicating a belief in Bitcoin's rising dominance. Crypto trader ""Beanie"" concurred, suggesting that Bitcoin's dominance tends to grow during bear markets as investors treat it as a relatively safe asset, favoring its stability over riskier and speculative digital assets. Beanie further expressed that the current trend mirrors the 2018 bear market, despite Bitcoin hitting an all-time high this month. In contrast to the 2021 bull market where Bitcoin's dominance fell from 70% to 40%, the current consolidation of dominance is more akin to bear market patterns. As of now, Bitcoin's market share stands at 50.1%, according to CoinStats data. However, not every trader is in agreement over this upward forecast. Crypto trader Zero Ika argued that from a macro perspective, Bitcoin's market share seems to be decreasing over the long term, stating that ""BTC D. is in a long-term downtrend."" BTC dominance chart on TradingView. Source: Zero Ika Therefore, future trends in Bitcoin's market dominance remain uncertain, with traders divided over the direction it will take. Nevertheless, the formation of an ascending triangle on the Bitcoin dominance chart hints at a potential upsurge, prompting market participants to keep a close watch on the cryptocurrency king's performance."
3/28/2024,BlackRock CEO Expresses Surprise at Bitcoin ETF Performance and Optimism for Long-Term Viability,"According to PANews, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink expressed his surprise at the performance of the Bitcoin ETF and reiterated his 'very optimistic' attitude towards the long-term viability of Bitcoin. In an interview with Fox Business on March 27, Fink said, 'IBIT is the fastest-growing ETF in history. No product in the history of ETFs has been able to accumulate assets as quickly as IBIT. We are now creating a more liquid, more transparent market, which is very surprising to me. Before we submitted our application, I never anticipated that we would see this kind of retail demand.' Fink also stated, 'I am very bullish on the long-term survival of Bitcoin.' Data from Farside Investors shows that IBIT performed strongly in its early trading days, attracting a total of $13.5 billion in inflows in the first 11 weeks, with a single-day high of $849 million on March 12. The average daily inflow for IBIT is slightly more than $260 million."
3/28/2024,Bitwise CIO Predicts Long-Term Inflows into Bitcoin ETFs as Adoption Grows,"According to CryptoPotato, Matt Hougan, the CIO of crypto index fund and asset management firm Bitwise, believes inflows into spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) will continue for years as more investors and institutions adopt the products. Hougan shared his experiences during a 20-day road trip, where he met financial advisors who have already allocated 3% of their client’s portfolios to Bitcoin ETFs and those who have not considered the products at all, highlighting a gap in the adoption pace. Hougan also engaged with national account platforms approving Bitcoin ETF investments later this month and others looking to do so in mid-2025. He said his findings indicated that the inflows the ETF market has experienced in the past two months are not a one-time occurrence but part of long-term sustained demand. The Bitwise CIO insisted that the situation of most professional investors, who are currently unable to buy Bitcoin ETFs, would change in the next couple of years as they conduct a series of individual due diligence processes. In addition, Hougan said the ramp-up of inflows into Bitcoin ETFs would be shorter than gold ETFs, which saw inflows built over their first seven years in the market. Market analysts think the former could surpass the latter within months if high inflows persist. Hougan also claimed that 3% is the new 1% in Bitcoin investment allocation. He explained that in his six years of speaking with professional investors about Bitcoin, the talks revolved around a 1% allocation. However, that has changed, as almost every wealth market investor he met on his road trip mentioned a 3% allocation as the ideal standard. Hougan added that the primary reason for this shift is that the launch of ETFs has de-risked the downside of Bitcoin. Before, people were worried Bitcoin could go to zero, but if that possibility is off the table, 3% or 5% starts to make more sense. Meanwhile, Hougan discovered that the demand for Bitcoin ETFs from U.K. investors is far behind the surge in the U.S."

3/28/2024,Bitcoin NFT Protocol Ordinals Introduces Runes for Native Digital Goods,"According to PANews, Casey Rodarmor, the founder of Bitcoin NFT protocol Ordinals, has announced the Runes documentation on the X platform. The document reveals that Runes allow Bitcoin transactions to etch, mint, and transfer native digital goods on the Bitcoin network. Although each inscription is unique, every unit of Runes is identical, making them interchangeable tokens suitable for various purposes. The Runes protocol, known as Runestones, is stored in Bitcoin transaction outputs. A transaction can have a maximum of one Runestone, which can etch a new , mint an existing Rune, and transfer Runes from the transaction input to the output. Transaction outputs can carry any number of Rune balances. Runes are formed through etching, which creates a Rune and sets its attributes. Once these attributes are set, they cannot be changed, and the Rune has pre-mining capabilities. The etcher of a Rune can choose to allocate the etched Rune units to themselves, a process known as pre-mining. Runestones can be malformed for various reasons, and these malformed Runestones are called cenotaphs. Runes inputted into cenotaph transactions are destroyed. The minting in transactions with cenotaphs counts towards the minting limit, but the minted Runes are burned. Cenotaphs serve as an upgrade mechanism, allowing Runes to be given new semantics, changing the way Runes are created and transferred without misleading un-upgraded clients about the location of these Runes, as they will see the Runes as destroyed."
3/28/2024,Hong Kong Expected to Approve Spot BTC ETF in Q2,"According to PANews, the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) is expected to approve a spot Bitcoin ( ) ETF in the second quarter of this year. This development could significantly change the landscape of crypto asset investments and potentially position Hong Kong as a global leader in the BTC ETF market. Noelle Acheson, a prominent figure in the crypto asset industry and author of Current Affairs, commented on the potential impact of this move, stating that the Asian crypto asset market is much larger than the US market in terms of trading volume. She outlined two possibilities: the existing high trading volume could indicate market saturation or suggest that the Asian market is more familiar with and knowledgeable about crypto assets. Acheson added that a Hong Kong-listed ETF could bring a large amount of capital into 'approved' investment portfolio allocations, implying a significant shift in investment flows. Bloomberg ETF expert Eric Balchunas highlighted the importance of Hong Kong approving a spot ETF with physical creation and redemption, contrasting it with the US, which only allows cash subscriptions. Balchunas said that this would help stimulate the rapidly growing asset management scale and trading volume in the region, giving Hong Kong a considerable strategic advantage. Caitlin Long, founder and CEO of Custodia Bank, also weighed in, emphasizing another key aspect of the proposed ETF structure in Hong Kong: the ability to directly extract BTC. This ensures that investors hold more than just 'paper BTC'. Long expressed excitement about this development, stating that if a spot ETF is approved in Hong Kong, it would be both huge and ironic, as US banks would be left out in the cold. The discussion around the potential of a Hong Kong BTC ETF has expanded from industry experts to the broader crypto asset community. Well-known analyst Bitcoin Munger believes that the catalytic effect of a Hong Kong ETF would be much greater than that of a US ETF. Munger cited Glassnode data showing that the supply of BTC has been shifting from the West to the East year by year, and he believes this trend strengthens the case for a Hong Kong ETF surpassing a US ETF. However, not everyone is convinced that a Hong Kong ETF will have a significant impact. Eric Balchunas cautioned against overestimating the market size of Hong Kong relative to the US, stating that Hong Kong is too small compared to the US. Bitcoin Munger countered that the success of a Hong Kong ETF may not yet be fully appreciated, and any positive surprises could catch analysts, including Balchunas, off guard."

3/29/2024,Is Bitcoin Market Cycle Normal or Left-Translated? CEO Benjamin Cowen Weighs In,"According to CryptoPotato, Into The Cryptoverse CEO Benjamin Cowen has postulated whether the current Bitcoin market cycle is normal or a “left-translated” one, where the peak occurs earlier than usual. Bitcoin has already reached a new all-time high, and there are still three weeks to go until the halving. This has introduced the possibility of this cycle peak coming much earlier than previous ones, which happened in the year following the halving event. If Bitcoin markets pull back after any Federal Reserve rate cuts, it could put it back on track with prior cycles, potentially peaking in 2025. However, if there is no significant correction or consolidation period, it could suggest a left-translated peak. Cowen believes the answer to whether this Bitcoin market cycle is a normal one or left-translated will depend on how the market reacts to rate cuts in a few months. The Fed kept rates the same at 5.5% during its last meeting on March 20, which initiated a lot of immediate volatility. Its next policy and rate decision meeting is in May, but 95.8% of observers think it will remain unchanged again, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. Cowen compared the price action in 2013 and 2021, with blow-off tops in April followed by another top in November. He suggested that a similar pattern in this cycle could indicate a left-translated cycle. Ultimately, this bull market cycle will be dependent on Bitcoin's reaction after rate cuts arrive later this year."

3/29/2024,"Spot Bitcoin ETFs Resume Positive Flows, Net Inflows Exceed $12 Billion","According to CryptoPotato, spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States have resumed positive flows, marking the fourth consecutive day of net inflows and concluding March on a strong note. The total net inflow for spot Bitcoin ETFs reached $183 million on March 28. SoSo Value data shows that the latest figures contributed to a cumulative net inflow of almost $12.13 billion. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) led the pack with more than $95 million net inflows, followed closely by Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) with $69.09 million. Bitwise’s BITB and 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) recorded $67 million and $27.6 million in inflows, while VanEck’s HODL settled with inflows of $20 million. However, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) continued to witness net outflows, shedding nearly $105 million from its product, the lowest since March 12th. This comes after a minor setback with five consecutive days of outflows from spot Bitcoin ETFs from March 18th to 22nd. During this time, Bitcoin briefly plunged below $63,000, sparking concerns among market participants. The rebound to $70,000 improved market sentiment, with the ETF space seeing increased demand and an influx of new players. Earlier this week, crypto asset management firm Hashdex announced plans to convert its futures fund, 'Hashdex Bitcoin Futures ETF,' to a spot Bitcoin ETF called 'Hashdex Bitcoin ETF' under the ticker 'DEFI' in partnership with Tidal Investments LLC. With this development, HashDEX has become the eleventh player to enter the competitive landscape, largely controlled by two major players – BlackRock and Fidelity. In a recent Fox Business interview, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink expressed his pleasant surprise regarding the performance of the spot Bitcoin ETF offered by his firm. He reaffirmed his strong optimism about the leading crypto asset’s long-term prospects and highlighted that he is 'very bullish' on its viability. Fink added that he was taken aback by the impressive performance of the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), especially during the initial 11 trading weeks, and said that the fund has exceeded his expectations."
3/29/2024,"Hedge Fund Kerrisdale Capital Longs BTC, Shorts MicroStrategy Stock","According to PANews, hedge fund Kerrisdale Capital has disclosed a subtle investment thesis: going long on Bitcoin ( ) while shorting MicroStrategy stock. The premise is that MicroStrategy, positioning itself as a BTC investment tool, has an unreasonable premium compared to the underlying crypto asset that mainly constitutes its value. Kerrisdale Capital's analysis states, ""MicroStrategy's stock price has soared with the recent rise in BTC prices, but as is often the case with crypto assets, things have gotten out of control."" Kerrisdale also highlighted a key difference, pointing out that MicroStrategy's stock price implies a BTC value of ""over $177,000, or 2.5 times the spot price of BTC."" In discussing the reasons behind MicroStrategy's stock price premium, Kerrisdale refuted some views supporting the company's market valuation. The report bluntly states, ""The reasons for giving a premium to MicroStrategy's stock are not enough to justify paying more than double the price for the same coin."" This statement emphasizes Kerrisdale's stance on MicroStrategy's overvaluation in terms of direct exposure. Since 1989, under the leadership of CEO Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy has been actively accumulating BTC and making it a core pillar of its investment strategy. From August 2020 to 2023, the company conducted significant financial operations to increase its holdings, currently exceeding 214,000 BTC. Kerrisdale's valuation method considers MicroStrategy's enterprise software business and its BTC reserves. The conclusion drawn from the analysis is that although the software business is still in operation, it ""no longer contributes meaningful value to the entire enterprise,"" highlighting the overwhelming impact of BTC on the company's valuation. A key criticism from Kerrisdale is the high premium of MicroStrategy's stock relative to its net asset value (NAV). The report notes, ""MicroStrategy's stock premium is 2.6 times, which is exceptionally high."" Kerrisdale believes that if MicroStrategy's stock premium rate is adjusted to a more historically consistent level, the stock will experience a significant decline relative to 's performance. The report delves into the potential impact of MicroStrategy's financial strategy, including its reliance on leverage and the dilutive effect of its financing mechanisms. Kerrisdale's analysis indicates that while MicroStrategy has successfully increased its BTC holdings through aggressive capital market activities, the dilutive effects of debt financing and stock issuance have caused the number of BTC per share to stagnate. Finally, Kerrisdale Capital estimates, ""If the current 2.6 times premium contract is adjusted to a more historically consistent 1.3 times, MSTR's decline relative to BTC will be 50%."" This conclusion is drawn after studying the interactions between MicroStrategy's stock premium, BTC holdings, and broader market dynamics."

4/1/2024,"Bitcoin Volatility on the Rise as Halving Nears, Surpasses Ethereum's Fluctuations","According to CoinDesk: Bitcoin's recent volatility has surpassed that of Ethereum's as the crypto market braces for Bitcoin's impending halving event. Data from Kaiko reveals that the annualized 30-day historical volatility of Bitcoin rose to nearly 60% last week, exceeding Ethereum's volatility by nearly 10 percentage points, marking the highest spread in at least a year. Traditionally, Bitcoin, with its massive market cap and trading volumes, serves as a relatively steady anchor in comparison to other digital assets, protecting trader portfolios from excessive market swings. However, the recent uptick in volatility levels is noteworthy. Several factors have contributed to this change, notably the greenlighting of nearly a dozen spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) alongside the upcoming Bitcoin blockchain reward halving. The halving event, expected to take place on April 21, will see the per-block reward to miners reduced from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC, effectively halving miners' revenue. While the consensus typically views halving as a bullish event due to the resultant demand-supply imbalance, some experts like Greg Magadini, the director of derivatives at Amberdata, caution that the extent of bullish positioning could trigger a ""sell-the-news"" pullback after the event, thereby causing more volatility. As the market navigates this period, traders and investors are advised to remain vigilant in the face of potentially heightened volatility in the lead-up to and follow-through of the Bitcoin halving."

From a shy emergence in 2009 to its market-leading dominance, the bitcoin story is perpetually evolving. Going back three years, the start of the last bull cycle saw experts sketching out the future of Bitcoin with scenarios ranging from extreme bullishness to bearishness. It's time to revisit and revamp these scenarios as Bitcoin is about to enter its fourth halving. Amid all the estimates and judgements, the essence remains intact: the future of Bitcoin is unpredictable. However, the unpredictability doesn't quench curiosity or sway enthusiasm. Many even believe that most of the significant use cases 10 years from now would seem mind-boggling today. Taking a leap in the future of Bitcoin, the array of predictions ranges from regulatory hardships to telepathic DeFi. One of them indicates a future where Bitcoin is widely used to pay for goods and services like coffee and beer, while others predict Bitcoin-powered gaming platforms. All these are part of the predictions from industry experts such as Cory Klippsten, CEO of Swan, Des Dickerson, CEO of THNDR Games, and author Isaiah Jackson. There might be scenarios where traditional finance institutions 'tame' Bitcoin or hefty regulations choke its growth. On the flip side, there's also a possibility of AI-powered Bitcoins, shadow Bitcoin, or Bitcoin thriving as a store of value. Other interesting trails lead to machines sending Bitcoin, rise of Bitcoin ordinals, Bitcoin remaining the same or even a fatal impact due to a Black Swan event. The most exciting prediction talks about the possibility of telepathic Bitcoin. In conclusion, Bitcoin is standing at the crossroads of numerous possibilities, each carrying its exclusive set of challenges and opportunities.

4/1/2024,"Bitcoin's Future Lies in Its Use as a Currency, Not an Asset","According to CoinDesk, recent optimism in the Bitcoin ecosystem has been driven by the approval of Bitcoin spot market exchange-traded funds (ETFs). However, the true potential of Bitcoin lies in its use as a currency rather than an asset held in ETFs or hardware wallets. Zac Townsend, CEO and co-founder of bitcoin-denominated insurance company Meanwhile, believes that the future of Bitcoin involves robust economic activity denominated in the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin's strengths lie in storing value, settling large payments, and conducting financial services. With at least 57 countries experiencing inflation rates over 10% last year, the day-to-day volatility of Bitcoin's exchange rate may seem less risky than the fiscal and monetary mismanagement of countries worldwide. For this future to exist, companies and institutions must be built within the Bitcoin economy. Meanwhile, one of the first fully-fledged, regulated life insurance companies denominated in Bitcoin, operates on a modified accounting basis with Bitcoin as the unit of currency, regulated by the Bermuda Monetary Authority. Operating on the Bitcoin Standard, Meanwhile's balance sheet and income statement are entirely in Bitcoin, with policyholders paying premiums and receiving claims in the cryptocurrency. This approach allows the company to operate without being affected by exchange rate fluctuations. As more businesses and individuals recognize the value of building on the Bitcoin Standard, the focus will shift from Bitcoin's exchange rate to its use as a store-of-value that will appreciate over time."

4/1/2024,MicroStrategy's Market Cap Surpasses Half of S&P 500 Companies Amid Crypto Rally,"According to Bloomberg, MicroStrategy, a software maker often considered a Bitcoin hedge fund, now has a market capitalization higher than nearly half of the companies in the S&P 500 Index. This is due to the strong crypto rally this year. However, the company's inclusion in the index is not straightforward, as it is largely viewed as a leveraged holding company for Bitcoin. MicroStrategy is one of the largest publicly-traded holders of Bitcoin, having started accumulating the cryptocurrency as an inflation hedge in 2020. The company currently holds 124,946 Bitcoins, worth approximately $6.8 billion. If MicroStrategy were to be included in the S&P 500, it would be one of the index's largest companies with a direct link to Bitcoin. This could be seen as symbolically significant for the $2.6 trillion crypto industry, especially after the collapse of multiple prominent firms in 2022. Despite the company's market capitalization, its inclusion in the S&P 500 is not guaranteed. MicroStrategy does not currently meet the requirements for inclusion, but its potential entry into the index would likely be viewed as a sign of renewed bullishness toward digital assets. This comes even as many Wall Street banks and professionals continue to shun cryptocurrencies."

4/1/2024,Bitcoin's Volatility Surpasses Ether's Amid ETF Inflows and Upcoming Halving,"According to CoinDesk, the spread between bitcoin and ether's annualized 30-day historical volatility gauges has increased to the highest in at least a year. The spot ETF inflows and Bitcoin blockchain's impending halving seem to have catalyzed greater volatility in . Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market value and trading volumes, is supposed to be relatively steady compared to other digital assets, protecting a trader's portfolio from wild swings in the broader market. However, bitcoin has been more volatile than ether recently. Bitcoin's annualized 30-day historical or realized volatility rose to nearly 60% late last week, surpassing ether's 30-day realized volatility by nearly 10 percentage points. That's the highest spread in at least a year, according to data tracked by Paris-based Kaiko. Historical volatility indicates the degree of price turbulence observed over a specific period. The bitcoin-ether volatility spread flipped positive weeks after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) greenlighted nearly a dozen spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), allowing traders to take exposure to the cryptocurrency without owning it. Since then, traders have been squarely focused on the activity in the spot ETFs, with net inflows breeding upside volatility in bitcoin and the broader crypto market. In the meantime, the dwindling probability of the SEC approving an ETH ETF by May seems to have demotivated ether traders. Bitcoin blockchain's upcoming reward halving, a quadrennial event that reduces the pace of per block emission by 50%, could be another reason for relatively higher volatility in the cryptocurrency. On April 21, the inbuilt code will reduce the per-block reward paid to miners to 3.125 BTC from 6.25 BTC, halving the miner's revenue, which, as per ByteTree, is currently at $26 billion annually. The consensus is that halving is bullish as it halves the pace of supply expansion, creating a demand-supply imbalance in favor of a price rise, assuming the demand side remains unchanged or strengthens.

4/2/2024,Bank of America Predicts $1.6 Trillion US Government Payout if Fed Doesn't Cut Interest Rates,"According to U.Today, Anthony Pompliano, a venture capitalist and Bitcoin advocate, shared a tweet about Bank of America's recent prediction that the US government may have to make a massive payout of $1.6 trillion in annual interest payments by December if the Federal Reserve does not cut interest rates. Many commentators suggested that this situation could lead to higher inflation in the US and mentioned Bitcoin as a potential inflation hedge and possibly the new money standard for the US economy if the US dollar fails. Pompliano appeared on CNBC's Squawk Box on April 1, discussing Bitcoin with the team of anchors. He explained that different people perceive Bitcoin as different types of assets, such as a risk-on investment or an inflation hedge/store of value. He gave examples of investors buying spot Bitcoin ETFs for profit and those investing in Bitcoin directly to protect their money from inflation. Pompliano also mentioned that in countries like Argentina, users prefer stablecoins backed by USD, while in Nigeria, many people stack Sats. He highlighted recent milestones for Bitcoin, such as its continuous growth for half a year and reaching its highest weekly, monthly, and quarterly close. In the past, such progress has led to Bitcoin appreciating by at least 300%. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $65,529 after falling 6% from the $69,700 level."

4/2/2024,Bitcoin and Ethereum Experience Brief Flash Crashes,"According to Foresight News, Bitcoin experienced a brief flash crash, dropping to 65,621 USDT and falling more than 6.54% within 24 hours. In addition, Ethereum also saw a short-lived flash crash, plummeting to 3,313 USDT and declining over 7% in the same time frame. Both cryptocurrencies have been subject to market fluctuations, with these recent flash crashes highlighting the volatility of the digital currency market.

4/2/2024,Dogecoin Creator Comments on Bitcoin Crash as Price Plummets 7.33%,"According to U.Today, Billy Markus, the software engineer who created the original cryptocurrency Dogecoin in collaboration with Jackson Palmer in 2013, commented on the recent Bitcoin price fall. Markus, known on Twitter as 'Shibetoshi Nakamoto,' posted a meme from the Star Wars II movie, suggesting that Bitcoin warned about its intention to crash on April Fool's day as a 'hilarious joke' but with no intention to recover from it. The world's pioneer cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, has astounded the cryptocurrency community by plummeting 7.33% and losing several thousand U.S. dollars in value within a few hours, as it fell from $69,700 to $64,700. On April 1, Grayscale ETF faced outflows of more than $302 million. Additionally, the odds of the Federal Reserve cutting down interest rates seem to be getting lower. These factors are likely the drivers that pushed Bitcoin down so far almost instantly. After these factors were spotted, the cryptocurrency market saw a whopping $500 million worth of crypto liquidations, according to data provided by CoinGlass. The single biggest liquidation amounted to the equivalent of nearly $8 million in crypto. Overall, according to Markus's earlier tweets, he does not believe that cryptocurrency price movements can be predicted, particularly for Bitcoin. His view is that crypto is mostly speculative assets, and holding it for a long time is not a mentally healthy pastime."
4/2/2024,"Top 5 Countries With Highest Bitcoin Interest: El Salvador, Nigeria, Liechtenstein, Switzerland, and Austria","According to CryptoPotato, El Salvador tops the list of countries with the highest interest in Bitcoin, as shown by Google Trends data. The Central American nation made headlines in 2021 when it became the first country to officially recognize Bitcoin as legal tender. Since then, its pro-Bitcoin political leader, Nayib Bukele, and his administration have outlined numerous Bitcoin-related initiatives, including a hospital paid with the cryptocurrency, volcano bonds, and mining with excess volcano energy. El Salvador has also been quietly accumulating , with data showing that the country currently holds $400 million worth of the cryptocurrency. Nigeria ranks second in interest in Bitcoin, despite the government's previous prohibition on banks servicing cryptocurrency clients. The African nation has been battling inflation for years and has blamed the cryptocurrency industry for its devaluating fiat currency. However, Nigerians have always been fond of Bitcoin and other digital assets, as shown by many surveys. The other three countries in the top five are Liechtenstein, Switzerland, and Austria. While not much has been said about the adoption levels of Liechtenstein and Austria, Switzerland is known for being pro-crypto, with multiple crypto exchange-traded products on the Swiss market, a local bank offering staking for different assets, and the Canton of Zug allowing certain payments to be made with Bitcoin and Ethereum."
4/2/2024,"Bitcoin Price Predicted to Reach $150,000 by 2024, Says Morgan Creek Capital Management CEO","According to CryptoPotato, Mark Yusko, CEO and CIO of Morgan Creek Capital Management, has predicted that Bitcoin's price could reach $150,000 by 2024. Yusko's bullish prediction comes as Bitcoin's price has increased by over 60% since the beginning of the year, breaking its 2021 all-time high of $69,050 and charting a new one of almost $74,000. The latest peak came ahead of the fourth halving for the first time ever, with just a month left until ’s production is sliced by half. Yusko highlighted Bitcoin's benefits over other cryptocurrencies and its merits when compared to gold during an interview with CNBC’s Fast Money. He believes that the spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States, which launched in January, are the primary factor behind BTC’s yearly rise. The financial products have seen massive demand from investors, with impressive net inflows for the first two and a half months of trading. Yusko also noted that there's still more room for growth for BTC, especially given the upcoming halving, scheduled to take place in late April. Looking at the broader scale, Yusko predicted that could increase its price against the dollar by 10x over the next decade, potentially reaching around $700,000 per Bitcoin. He is not the only prominent individual who has forecasted a $150,000 price tag for Bitcoin this year. Fundstrat’s Tom Lee also indicated that the asset could more than double its value from its current position in 2024 due to its appeal to Millennials and Gen Z. Additionally, British multinational banking giant Standard Chartered, which used to be among Bitcoin’s most vocal critics, shared a similar prediction for the asset. In a recent report, the bank’s analysts increased their previous forecast by 50% and said BTC could tap $150,000 in 2024 and $250,000 by the end of next year."
4/2/2024,Bitcoin Resets Key Metrics as BTC Experiences 7% April Dip,"According to Cointelegraph: Despite a price dip of around 7% in April, causing the BTC price to currently hover around $66,000, Bitcoin is seeing a reassessment of essential metrics as the downturn clears out leveraged positions. BTC/USD 1-hour chart. Source: TradingView The BTC sell-off resulted in a significant liquidation event, culminating in a total of $400 million for Bitcoin and altcoins combined. The fallout resulted in negative funding rates, leading some traders to suggest that all leverage must be destroyed before price discovery. Retail-heavy exchanges such as Binance saw perp funding rates deflate from highs of 77% down to zero. While perp funding rates have compressed, there has been mention that the rest of the forward curve remains high, leading to speculation if the current downturn will bring the overall curve downward.

The drop from $69,450 to $65,970 happened in less than 30 minutes in the early hours of April 2, and was followed by a significant $165 million worth of leveraged positions being liquidated. Bitcoin tumbled over 5% in a sudden tumble on April 2. Source: TradingView The most significant losses came from long positions in Bitcoin of just over $50 million and in Ether of more than $40 million. Meanwhile, Dogecoin and Solana saw liquidations of roughly $6 million and $4 million respectively. Notably, Bitcoin’s plunge coincided with a net outflow of $86 million in Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), ending a four-day positive inflow streak. Despite BlackRock’s ETF posting a net inflow of $165.9 million, the overall negative figure was driven by Grayscale’s GBTC posting a substantial $302 million in outflows. Bitcoin’s sudden drawdown caused a $165 million leverage flush.

This could be due to an API error in certain data trackers or a genuine momentary drop in the value of the currency, although this brief depegging was not registered on all price trackers.

4/2/2024,Digital Asset Investment Products Record $862 Million Inflows,"According to CoinDesk, digital asset investment products recorded inflows of $862 million last week, following outflows of nearly $1 billion the week before. The trend was led by U.S.-based funds, which saw $897 million of inflows, while Europe and Canada witnessed a combined $49 million of outflows. The recovery coincided with a recovery in 's price, which sat at just under $70,000 on March 29, up nearly 10% on a week earlier. The CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20) rose around 8.6% during the same period. However, BTC has started this week in the red, currently down nearly 6% in the last 24 hours, sitting just below $65,500. CD20 has declined 7.28%. BTC-related inflows totaled $865 million throughout the week, according to CoinShares' data. The bitcoin ETFs of BlackRock (IBIT) and Fidelity (FBTC) both registered over $600 million of inflows, offsetting the $960 million exiting Grayscale's GBTC. CoinShares noted that while the recovery is encouraging, ETF activity is slowing down, with daily trading turnover now at $5.4 billion, down 36% relative to its peak three weeks ago. However, this remains well above the $347 million 2023 average, implying the initial market hype is cooling. The previous week's $1 billion of outflows brought to an end a run of seven straight weeks of net inflows, culminating in nearly $3 billion being registered in the week ending March 15."

4/3/2024,Quantitative Hedge-Fund Investors Find Profit in Bitcoin's Volatility,"According to Bloomberg, Bitcoin's notorious price fluctuations are proving to be profitable for quantitative hedge-fund investors and academic researchers. A growing body of research, including studies from the world's largest publicly traded hedge-fund manager, Man Group Plc, and the University of Cambridge, suggests that the quant strategy of trend following is particularly effective for Bitcoin's price volatility. Quant funds such as the $2 billion Florin Court Capital LLC have been using these strategies since 2017, and their cross-asset performance has been enhanced by crypto exposure. Researchers at Man Group's Man AHL unit found that a proxy long-short trend strategy in both Bitcoin and Ether has outperformed buy-and-hold investments in the coins since 2017 when scaled for 10% volatility. This strategy captures gains during a rally and takes short positions when the trend is negative. However, there are challenges to this approach. The relatively small crypto data sets are cited as a barrier to broader implementation of systematic trading. Furthermore, the models Man Group uses rely on data starting in 2016-2017, when institutional investors became more active in the space. The trend-following strategy is not only being examined by sophisticated hedge funds but is also going mainstream. Investors can now access a similar strategy through an exchange-traded product. This product dynamically allocates between Bitcoin futures and Treasury bills with a maturity of one to three months. The ETF increases exposure to Bitcoin futures when prices rise and reduces its allocation when prices fall, without ever going short. Despite the promising results of trend following for Bitcoin and Ether, quants remain cautious about applying these systematic techniques elsewhere in the crypto space. Stablecoins, which are intended to track an asset like the US dollar one-for-one, are obvious examples. So are the highly speculative, often-novelty tokens known as memecoins, which can be much more volatile than Bitcoin and Ether."

4/3/2024,Prominent Investor Kiyosaki Responds To Dent's Prediction Of Bitcoin Crash,"According to U.Today, Robert Kiyosaki, a well-known investor and author of 'Rich Dad Poor Dad', has responded to a prediction made by economist and financial writer Harry Dent on a social media platform. has forecasted a significant crash in the financial market, which he refers to as 'the biggest everything crash'. He believes that the 'Baby Boom Generation' will be the most affected as their real estate values plummet. Dent also predicts an 80% fall in the S&P index and a drop in Bitcoin's value to $200 per coin, a price last seen in 2013. Kiyosaki, in response to Dent's predictions, stated that if Bitcoin's value does indeed fall to $200, he would purchase as many coins as possible. He also plans to invest more in real estate, gold, and silver. Kiyosaki believes that those who hold onto their Bitcoin, gold, and silver will see an increase in their wealth, regardless of whether Dent's predictions come true or not. He reminded his 2.1 million followers that 'Gold and silver are God's money. Bitcoin is people’s money and the dollar is fake money.' Kiyosaki has previously expressed his intention to acquire 10 more Bitcoins before April, the month when the fourth Bitcoin halving is scheduled this year. He also acknowledged the possibility of Bitcoin being a scam but stated that it doesn't concern him as he believes all global fiat currencies could be considered scams as well."

4/3/2024,"Bitcoin's Rise Linked to Global Currency Devaluations, Says Cathie Wood","According to CoinDesk, Cathie Wood, CEO of Invest, has attributed the surge in Bitcoin's value this year to currency devaluations in countries like Nigeria, Egypt, and Argentina. She has described Bitcoin as an 'insurance policy' against unstable regimes and poor fiscal and monetary policies. Bitcoin has seen a growth of over 130% in the past year, reaching a record high of $73,800 last month. This rise coincided with a surge in demand from spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States. In an interview with CNBC, Wood highlighted a different narrative, stating that global currency devaluations, which are not being widely discussed, are contributing to Bitcoin's rise. She pointed out that the Nigerian Naira has depreciated by 50-60% in the past nine months, Egypt's currency has been devalued by 40%, and Argentina continues to devalue its currency. Wood believes that these devaluations are leading people to seek safety in Bitcoin as a hedge against the loss of purchasing power and wealth. Two weeks ago, Wood reiterated her prediction of a $1.5 million price target for Bitcoin, referring to it as a 'financial highway.' She noted that even in the United States, when regional banks collapsed last year, Bitcoin's value increased by 40%. She emphasized that Bitcoin does not carry counterparty risk, making it both a risk-on and risk-off asset. She recalled that Invest first invested in Bitcoin when it was valued at $250, at a time when Greece was considering exiting the Eurozone."
4/3/2024,Bitcoin's Total Supply Incorrectly Estimated by MicroStrategy's Michael Saylor,"According to U.Today, Michael Saylor, the cofounder and chairman of MicroStrategy, recently made a statement about Bitcoin's ( ) scarcity on his official Twitter account. He claimed that the total issuance of Bitcoin will never exceed 276^3. However, this estimation, while mathematically correct, is technically incorrect in terms of Bitcoin's total supply. The figure of 276^3 equates to 21,024,576. However, according to the original design of Bitcoin by Satoshi Nakamoto, only 21 million BTC units can ever be issued. Currently, the circulating supply of Bitcoin is 19,671,900 BTC, leaving only about 1,328,100 BTC units left for mining. Saylor's statement can be seen as a call to action to purchase Bitcoin, a sentiment echoed by other major proponents such as Robert Kiyosaki, author of 'Rich Dad Poor Dad'. The upcoming Bitcoin halving event will reduce the rate of emission of the digital currency by half, making any potential accumulation move more expensive. The remaining 1.3 million Bitcoin units will not be released until 2140, and there will be no increase in this number. Saylor's firm, MicroStrategy, has been a consistent buyer of Bitcoin since 2020, accumulating more than 214,000 Bitcoin units. The business intelligence and software firm has even issued Convertible Senior Notes with different maturity dates to invest in the digital currency. MicroStrategy has positioned itself as a Bitcoin evangelist, a role that complements those of market leaders like Samson Mow. While the impact of Saylor's posts on Twitter is immeasurable, his commitment to maintaining his Bitcoin investments has encouraged many Bitcoin holders to stick to their convictions."

4/3/2024,"Bitcoin Stays Near $66,000 Amid Market Weakness and Decreased Crypto Futures","According to CoinDesk, Bitcoin is currently trading near $66,000, indicating a potential end to a two-month rally as the CoinDesk20 Index signals a broader market weakness. The rates and open interest of crypto futures have also seen a decrease. During the Asian trading hours on Tuesday, Bitcoin managed to hold on to its losses as traders considered the resurgence of Treasury yields and the possibility of the Federal Reserve delaying rate cuts until later this year. Ether ( ) was trading above $3,300 at the time of writing, while the CoinDesk 20 (CD20) was down 0.6% to 2,532. The 10-year Treasury note yield reached a two-week high of 4.40% overnight due to persistent inflation and unexpectedly strong manufacturing activity. An increase in the so-called risk-free rate usually triggers a money outflow from risk assets and zero-yielding investments like gold. However, gold remained resilient amid the weak tone in Bitcoin and Wall Street’s tech-heavy index, Nasdaq. Bitcoin's decline to $65,000 is largely attributed to the recent macro outlook on interest rates and rising Treasury yields, according to Semir Gabeljic, director of capital formation at Pythagoras Investments. He noted that higher interest rate environments typically tend to reduce investor appetite to risk. On Polymarket, bettors have ruled out a rate cut by May and are split 50-50 on whether one will happen in June. Most of the certain money is on it happening in the fall. The CME Fed Watch tool indicates a 97% chance of rates staying the same after May’s meeting. Data from Coinglass shows that over $245 million in long positions have been liquidated in the last 24 hours, with $60 million in positions getting liquidated. Jun-Young Heo, a Derivatives Trader at Singapore-based Presto, stated that perpetual futures funding rates for most crypto assets are back to 1bps, and global futures open interest decreased by 10 percent overnight, indicating some leveraged long positions are closed. He added that as recent Bitcoin ETF inflows are stagnating and BTC and market prices came below the 20-day moving average, some trend followers would have regarded yesterday’s downturn as the end of a two-month-long rally."

4/3/2024,Bitcoin Cash Cuts New Token Supply by 50% Ahead of Bitcoin's Halving,"According to Bloomberg, Bitcoin Cash, a cryptocurrency that split from Bitcoin in 2017, is reducing its supply of newly minted tokens by 50% today. This move comes as a precursor to Bitcoin's own 'halving' event, which is expected to occur in approximately 16 days. Bitcoin Cash was a significant player in the 'forking' trend, where multiple software development teams attempted to create new forms of currency by modifying the original Bitcoin computer code and releasing coins with 'Bitcoin' in their names. Bitcoin Cash's supporters include Bitcoin, which is also set to undergo a reduction in the supply of its newly minted coins. These coins are awarded to the computers, known as miners, that support its network. Historically, Bitcoin halvings, which limit the coin supply, have been known to trigger market booms.

Among these, IBIT saw a net inflow of around $150 million, while FBTC had a net inflow of $44.8 million. In contrast, Grayscale's GBTC experienced a net outflow of $81.9 million. These figures indicate a growing interest in Bitcoin spot ETFs among investors, as they seek exposure to the cryptocurrency market. The net inflows into IBIT and FBTC suggest that these ETFs are gaining traction, while the net outflow from GBTC could be attributed to investors reallocating their funds to other investment options. Overall, the data highlights the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market and the evolving preferences of investors."
4/3/2024,Holding Bitcoin Proves Profitable 99.92% of Trading Days in its History,"According to Cointelegraph: Analysis shows that holding Bitcoin has been a profitable move for 99.92% of all trading days since it was launched over 14 years ago on January 3, 2009. In fact, only six specific days–those between March 9–13 and March 25–29–when Bitcoin was purchased, turned out to be unprofitable as per the data from crypto financial services firm Blockchain.com.

Although the token has since been trading comfortably around the $68,000–$70,000 range, the small level of market volatility-induced price fluctuations have left a handful of Bitcoin holders at a loss. Breaking down Bitcoin wallet holders' distribution, it's estimated that 86.28% of all wallets hold up to $1,000, 13.03% hold between $1,000 to $10,000, and a mere 0.69% hold $100,000 in Bitcoin.

4/3/2024,Bitcoin's Dominance Over Gold Predicted By Veteran Trader,"According to U.Today, Peter Brandt, a well-known trader, recently made a bold statement about Bitcoin, claiming its long-term superiority over gold. Brandt, who has extensive experience in trading, portrayed Bitcoin as the undisputed king, reducing gold to the status of a mere baron and referring to silver as the court jester. He supported his claim with a compelling chart that showed the steady decrease in gold's value compared to Bitcoin since the latter's introduction on exchanges in the early 2010s. Over a 12-year period, the value of gold fell from 740 to just 0.0352 BTC, reinforcing Brandt's optimistic view of Bitcoin's dominance. Despite Brandt's firm prediction, the immediate landscape offers a more nuanced view. ETF expert Eric Balchunas recently pointed out a potential shift in market sentiment, noting a resurgence in the appeal of gold compared to BTC. Balchunas suggested that the growing interest in gold, along with Bitcoin's recent struggles, could indicate a temporary shift of funds away from the cryptocurrency. He hinted at a possible end to the unprecedented 54-day streak of inflows into Bitcoin ETFs, speculating that investors might shift their focus to gold and related instruments. While Brandt's long-term vision emphasizes Bitcoin's lasting dominance, Balchunas' observations suggest short-term fluctuations that could affect market dynamics. These contrasting views set the stage for a dynamic interaction between Bitcoin and gold in the financial market."
4/4/2024,Bitcoin's Impact On Traditional Financial System: A Matrix-Inspired Analogy,"According to U.Today, Samson Mow, the CEO of Jan3 and a well-known Bitcoin advocate, recently drew a comparison between Bitcoin and from the iconic film 'The Matrix' on social media. Mow likened Bitcoin's penetration into the traditional financial system to the scene in the movie where Neo dives into Agent Smith, causing an explosion. He suggested that Bitcoin, like Neo, has infiltrated the legacy financial system through spot ETFs and is now operating within it. Mow did not predict a specific outcome but expressed his anticipation for the unfolding events, particularly whether Bitcoin ETFs will succeed in transforming the traditional financial system. His recent posts suggest that he expects Bitcoin to permanently alter the legacy system. Mow strongly believes that Bitcoin will reach the $1 million mark in the near future, with the recently launched spot ETFs bringing this moment closer. Another key catalyst Mow often mentions is the upcoming Bitcoin halvening, scheduled for the latter part of April. This event will reduce miners' rewards from 6.25 per block to 3.125 BTC for each new block generated. Mow and other Bitcoin enthusiasts believe that the halvening will create a supply shock, while ETFs have already caused a demand shock. They anticipate a surge in the BTC price when these two shocks collide. In related news, the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) outperformed other ETFs on April 3, with a massive inflow of $116.7 million, according to a tweet from the @spotonchain analytics account. Meanwhile, outflows from Grayscale's GBTC ETF fell to $75.1 million, marking the lowest level in the past trading month for this spot-based Bitcoin exchange-traded product."
4/4/2024,"Bitcoin Price Recovers After Slump, Altcoins See Red","According to CryptoPotato, Bitcoin's price experienced a slump, falling below $66,000 several times yesterday. However, it managed to recover and is currently hovering just above this level. Most altcoins, including , , and , have seen a decrease in value. Bitcoin's price has been unstable since the weekend when it failed to surpass the $72,000 mark. The cryptocurrency began the week with a significant price drop, falling from $70,000 to under $66,500. The situation worsened the following day when Bitcoin's value further decreased to a 10-day low of $64,400.

After several delays, the event, which is the second of its kind in Bitcoin Cash's history, finally took place, reducing the rewards to 6.25 per block. This event led to a surge in Bitcoin Cash's price over the past week. Despite a significant retracement yesterday, Bitcoin Cash is currently the top performer, with a 10% increase pushing its value to over $670. On the other hand, most of the top 15 cryptocurrencies are in the red, with , , , and ICP leading the losses.

4/4/2024,Blockstream CEO Advocates For Bitcoin Over DeFi Platforms,"According to U.Today, Blockstream CEO Adam Back has expressed his support for Bitcoin ( ) and advised caution when speculating with decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms. Back shared his views on digital assets with the crypto community via the X app. He argued that Bitcoin's benefits are numerous and it could be cold stored instead of being used in DeFi. He believes that Bitcoin is a viable long-term asset and a store of value. Back's views align with those of Robert Kiyosaki, a renowned finance management expert, who believes that due to the current inflationary trend, it is crucial to store value in tangible assets like gold, silver, and Bitcoin. Back expressed his skepticism about participating in DeFi, stating that some people are determined to speculate on DeFi platforms without learning from past mistakes. He suggested that buying Bitcoin and cold storing it is a safer and more profitable strategy. In response to questions about his Bitcoin strategy, Back revealed that he maintains a long-term hold strategy as he is convinced of Bitcoin's value proposition. Even during market cycles when Bitcoin peaks, while other investors sell to buy back at lower prices, Back prefers to hold. He stated, 'I have a really hard time selling Bitcoin. So, I'm typically perpetually all out of fiat.' While Back is not against diversifying assets, he advises caution, particularly when it comes to complex and risky DeFi platforms. He recommends platforms like Hodl Hodl, Debificom, or Unchainedcom, which he believes are simple, robust, and secure. Analysts have noted that Back's approach to cryptocurrency investment is conservative, prioritizing the stability and security offered by Bitcoin over the potential of DeFi, despite signs of a strong recovery for the DeFi segment after the 'Crypto Winter', according to a recent report."

4/4/2024,Retrospective Analysis: Bitcoin Halvings and Impact on Crypto Market Dynamics,"Bitcoin halvings, which are automated reductions in the issuance of new BTC tokens, have historically created ripples across the cryptocurrency industry. These events impact the supply dynamics of Bitcoin, trigger changes in market sentiment, and drive its adoption rates to new heights. These critical events, which increase Bitcoin's visibility, have always led to a rise in Bitcoin prices as well as adoption rates. As the number of BTC tokens available for mining gets halved, discussions around the blockchain technology used, the dynamics of the Bitcoin network, and the place of cryptocurrencies as unique asset classes within the financial markets often get amplified. Despite the historical patterns showing that Bitcoin prices and adoption usually increase in the months after a halving event, it's important to note that the upcoming April 2024 halving is already exhibiting unique characteristics. The 2024 halving deviates from previous halvings, hinting already at unprecedented market movements. A Bitcoin halving fundamentally shifts the crypto ecosystem, reshaping market dynamics and investor sentiment. Each halving cycles Bitcoins visibility, adoption, and innovation through newfound peaks, reinforcing its tag as the locomotive of the ever-evolving crypto ecosystem. Often, Bitcoin's heightened visibility around halving events lures new participants into the market. Furthermore, the events pressure cryptocurrency initiatives to reassess the underlying technology and network dynamics as miners prepare for the aftermath, which usually sees mining profitability margins dwindle. This tends to drive network enhancements and innovation while increasing the network's appeal to a broader audience. Historical data shows that the number of active BTC addresses often grows by roughly 90% within the first 150 days of halving events. This sheds light on Bitcoin's adoption post-halving events. Institutional interest in Bitcoin also surges around these events, spurred by the narrative of Bitcoin's potential as an anti-inflationary store of value and investable asset. However, despite these broad narratives and developments, Bitcoin halvings each represent a unique shift in the evolution of the flagship cryptocurrency. These shifts are heavily influenced by market conditions, regulatory developments, and advancements in technology, requiring caution and vigilance from participants navigating the landscape of digital assets. The upcoming 2024 halving in April is no exception and will take place amidst its unique circumstances, including unprecedented inflows back into the crypto industry and burgeoning institutional engagement advanced by recent US approvals of spot BTC ETFs.

4/4/2024,"Bitcoin's Potential Rise To $82,000 Predicted By Crypto Analyst","According to U.Today, Bitcoin ( ) is on a potentially profitable path, with a respected crypto analyst, Jelle, forecasting a strong target of $82,000 for the BTC price. This prediction is based on the observation of a bullish pennant formation, a technical pattern that could indicate an upcoming price increase. Despite any short-term volatility or consolidation, the bullish pennant formation implies that the overall momentum remains positive, potentially leading to a breakout and continuation of the upward trend. Jelle's identification of this pattern suggests that he believes Bitcoin is set for further upward movement, supporting his $82,000 target. This analysis comes at a critical time, with the Bitcoin halving event just 15 days away. The halving event, which happens approximately every four years, halves the reward for mining new Bitcoin blocks, resulting in a reduced supply of new coins entering circulation. This built-in scarcity mechanism has historically triggered bullish price movements, as the decreased supply often drives increased demand and speculative buying. It's important to note that the Bitcoin halving event doesn't just reduce the supply of new coins; it also serves as a symbolic reminder of Bitcoin's deflationary nature and the finite nature of its total supply. This narrative often resonates with investors and contributes to the overall bullish sentiment surrounding Bitcoin during these periods. Despite Bitcoin's current trading price of $66,354, Jelle's ambitious target of $82,000 doesn't seem as unrealistic as it might initially seem. recently reached an all-time high of $73,805.27 on March 14, demonstrating its potential for significant price appreciation. Considering the historical impact of the halving event on Bitcoin's price, surpassing the previous all-time high and reaching Jelle's target becomes a plausible scenario. The optimism surrounding Bitcoin's price trajectory is further reinforced by historical data. Previous halving events in 2016 and 2020 were followed by extended bull runs that saw the BTC price multiply several times over. This consistent pattern of post-halving price appreciation has instilled confidence in the community, fueling expectations of another substantial price rally in the near future."

4/4/2024,MicroStrategy CEO and Financial Expert Engage in Bitcoin Debate,"According to U.Today, a recent social media dispute has emerged between MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor and financial expert Peter Schiff. The disagreement was sparked by Saylor's comment about Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin. Saylor, a well-known Bitcoin advocate, boldly stated that in the future, everything before Satoshi will be considered as nonsense. Schiff, a known Bitcoin skeptic, expressed a contrasting view, suggesting that in time, Satoshi will be seen as nonsense. This latest clash adds to the ongoing debate between these two prominent figures. Schiff had previously criticized Saylor's decision to buy an additional 9,245 last month, warning MicroStrategy of potential losses. Schiff suggested scenarios where Bitcoin's price could drop to $20,000 or even $10,000, resulting in billions of losses for the company. Despite the differing opinions about Satoshi Nakamoto and Bitcoin within the crypto community and financial circles, the primary cryptocurrency's price is showing growth in today's crypto market trading. This growth is a continuation of the previous day's positive close. However, at the start of the week, Bitcoin's price is down 7%, quoted at $66,300.

These include Citadel, Goldman Sachs, UBS, and Citigroup, all of which are participating for the first time. The key takeaway is that large corporations are now eager to get involved, or are now willing to publicly associate themselves with this. BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, has been making significant moves in the cryptocurrency space. The addition of these new authorized participants to its Bitcoin ETF is a clear indication of the growing interest and acceptance of digital assets among traditional financial institutions. This move by BlackRock could potentially pave the way for more institutional involvement in the cryptocurrency market. The involvement of these major financial institutions not only validates the legitimacy of Bitcoin as an investment asset but also provides a significant boost to the overall cryptocurrency market. The willingness of these institutions to publicly associate themselves with Bitcoin is a positive sign for the future of the cryptocurrency market.

4/5/2024,Bhutan's Investment Arm and Bitdeer Plan to Boost Bitcoin Mining Capacity,"According to Bloomberg, Bhutan's investment arm, DHI, and Bitdeer, a Singapore-based company, have announced plans to increase the Himalayan kingdom's Bitcoin mining capacity by 500 megawatts by the first half of 2025. The capital for this expansion will be sourced from a $500 million fund that the two entities began raising in May last year. The fund was established with the aim of leveraging Bhutan's abundant hydroelectric power for Bitcoin mining. Bitdeer's CEO, Kong, anticipates the fund will be closed by July. Bitcoin miners use power-intensive computers to secure the blockchain, earning new tokens as a reward. These rewards are programmed to be halved every four years, a process designed to cap the total supply of the original cryptocurrency at 21 million coins. The upcoming halving in April will see mining rewards reduced from 6.25 to 3.125 coins per block. Despite this, DHI and Bitdeer are confident they can maintain operational efficiency even if the price of Bitcoin declines post-halving. Bitdeer boasts one of the industry's lowest costs per Bitcoin mined, at $20,000 per coin. The crypto sector faced a significant challenge in 2022 when soaring energy costs and Bitcoin's price falling below $16,000 led to some miners going bankrupt. The rising costs of Bitcoin computing are due to an increase in Bitcoin's mining difficulty, a measure of the computing power required to add a new block to the network. This difficulty has reached record highs ahead of the halving, offsetting some of the gains from the price rally. Bhutan, located between China and India, has been seeking ways to diversify its hydropower-dependent economy. DHI, which manages the government's diverse investments, views blockchain technology as a crucial component in building an 'innovation ecosystem for a startup economy.' The investment arm has been exploring asset tokenization and is also developing 'Bhutanverse,' a metaverse project."
4/5/2024,"Bitcoin ETFs Impact on Market Might Take Years, Say Top Traders","According to U.Today, the influence of Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) on the Bitcoin market may take longer to fully materialize than initially anticipated, according to leading traders. ETFs, which provide a new avenue for regular investors to invest in Bitcoin without directly purchasing the cryptocurrency, are believed to have a significant future impact on the influx of capital into Bitcoin. However, this effect is expected to unfold over several years. The slow pace of traditional finance is cited as a reason for this gradual impact. While ETFs could potentially stabilize Bitcoin's price, this is contingent on clear regulations and continuous improvements in the crypto sector. Currently, the funds coming into Bitcoin due to ETFs are considered supplementary. Bitcoin's current price hovers around $66,000, with potential support levels identified at approximately $63,700 and $56,435, corresponding to the 50 EMA and 100 EMA. If the price drops to these levels, it could potentially rebound. However, a fall below these lines might trigger a further decline. The future of Bitcoin appears promising with the attraction of institutional funds. If ETF inflows persist, Bitcoin's price could potentially surpass the $69,000 mark in the foreseeable future. However, as ETFs are still evolving, their true impact on the market is yet to be fully realized. The attraction of traditional funds is a positive trend for the digital gold, but more time is needed to fully observe this effect on the market."

Bitcoin Cash, a proof-of-work blockchain, was created as a cheaper and faster alternative to the original Bitcoin chain, from which it forked in 2017. Despite its lower market cap of around $13 billion, compared to Bitcoin's $1.3 trillion, the price of BCH has been gradually increasing, shadowing Bitcoin's gains.

4/5/2024,"Bitcoin's Halving Cycle Mirrors Previous Events, Says Analyst","According to CryptoPotato, Bitcoin ( ) is currently in the first phase of its halving cycle, aligning with analysts' predictions. Crypto trader and analyst Rekt Capital has stated that the recent 18% retrace in Bitcoin's value was anticipated, as similar declines were observed prior to the second and third halvings. This suggests that Bitcoin may follow patterns seen in previous halving events, including a post-halving surge that could drive the asset to new peaks. The three stages of the Bitcoin halving include the final pre-halving retrace, the re-accumulation, and the parabolic uptrend. The initial stage typically takes place 28 to 14 days before the event and can last for several weeks. The second phase begins after the retrace has bottomed out and can continue for up to five months, while the third phase can extend for over a year. During the 2016 halving, the retrace was 38% and lasted four days. In 2020, it was 20% and lasted eight weeks. Currently, with Bitcoin approximately 13 days away from the halving, the asset has seen a roughly 18% decline over the past three weeks. Rekt Capital noted that this cycle has shown characteristics from both the 2016 and 2020 halvings, suggesting that it may replicate parts of their pre-halving price behaviors. On-chain metrics indicate that Bitcoin may be entering the re-accumulation phase. With the asset's resistance level at $70,000, Rekt Capital suggests that the market may have set the high re-accumulation range. As re-accumulation follows the bottoming out of the retrace, it is also possible that the pre-halving bottom has been reached. According to Rekt Capital, the goal now is for Bitcoin to move sideways until the halving and beyond. This is the first time the re-accumulation range is forming around the new all-time high area, which could potentially shorten the duration of this phase and cause the range to resemble the regular sideways movement observed in the market so far."

4/5/2024,Crypto Community Celebrates Alleged Birthday of Bitcoin's Mysterious Founder Amid Market Fluctuations,"According to U.Today, the cryptocurrency community is marking a significant yet enigmatic event today: the supposed birthday of Satoshi Nakamoto, the elusive creator of Bitcoin. The identity of Satoshi has been a topic of fascination since Bitcoin's inception in 2009. Despite the mystery surrounding Nakamoto's true identity, the birth date associated with the pseudonym, April 5, 1975, represents a symbolic milestone for the cryptocurrency community. Interestingly, this cryptic celebration coincided with a noticeable decline in Bitcoin's price. As the new trading session began, Bitcoin saw a 2.5% decrease, hitting a low of $65,930. Despite this downturn, Bitcoin maintains its market dominance with an impressive capitalization of $1.32 trillion. This positions Bitcoin among the top companies worldwide, nestled between tech behemoths Amazon and Meta, formerly known as Facebook. Regardless of market volatility, Bitcoin's sustained prominence highlights its resilience and significance in the financial sector. Since its creation, Bitcoin has risen above its mysterious beginnings to become a powerful asset, challenging traditional concepts of currency and investment. While the identity of its creator remains an enticing mystery, Bitcoin's impact echoes across global markets, shaping the future of finance in novel ways. On this symbolic yet turbulent day, the cryptocurrency community not only celebrates the birth of Bitcoin's enigmatic creator but also the resilience of the revolutionary digital currency he introduced."
4/5/2024,MicroStrategy Shares Surge Amid Bitcoin Exposure,"According to Bloomberg, MicroStrategy's stock has significantly outperformed Wall Street's targets over the past month, largely due to the company's exposure to Bitcoin. Analyst Harte noted that the premium investors are willing to pay for this exposure has established a new norm above 2x, based on a sum-of-the-parts analysis. He also anticipates that the company will benefit from Bitcoin-related catalysts in the coming year, particularly the Bitcoin halving event expected to occur this month. However, the close correlation between the company's stock and a cryptocurrency is a risky proposition. While the stock trades at a premium to Bitcoin, it also suffers more significant losses during downturns. This was evident when MicroStrategy shares dropped by as much as 3.2% in intraday trading on a recent Friday, due to a reversal in Bitcoin. Harte's projections for MicroStrategy further highlight the risks. He estimates that shares could drop to $700 if the premium decreases and regulatory pressures impact the cryptocurrency market, causing Bitcoin to fall back towards $48,000. On the other hand, if Bitcoin surges above $90,000 and the premium on the company's holdings increases, the stock price could reach $2,700, representing a nearly 70% gain from current trading levels. For now, Harte believes the upcoming April halving will be a positive catalyst for both the stock and the price of Bitcoin. He noted that following the previous three halving events, the price of one Bitcoin increased by 80x, 4x, and 6x in the subsequent year. As such, he suggests that investors view Bitcoin as a safe haven from inflation amid fiscal stimulus from central banks, and expects continued adoption from institutional investors as Bitcoin serves as a disinflationary asset."

4/6/2024,"Bitcoin Valuation Could Rise Tenfold, Predicts Investor Anthony Scaramucci","According to U.Today, renowned investor Anthony Scaramucci has predicted a significant rise in Bitcoin's value ahead of the anticipated halving event in April. Scaramucci believes that the halving, a process where miner rewards are halved, is not yet factored into the current Bitcoin price. He suggests that Bitcoin's valuation could increase by as much as ten times from its current level, potentially reaching half the valuation of gold. However, he clarified that this surge would not occur in the short term. In April 2024, the Bitcoin market is witnessing substantial growth, with the introduction of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) driving over $10 billion in new flows for Bitcoin. This achievement surpasses the $10 billion milestone reached by the Gold ETF in just a quarter of the time. Despite Bitcoin's potential, Scaramucci acknowledges its volatility and cyclical nature. He predicts a potential price target of $170,000 for this cycle, driven by of demand and adoption. Scaramucci, a vocal Bitcoin advocate, has been actively promoting its transformative potential. He remains optimistic about Bitcoin ETFs, drawing comparisons between Bitcoin and Gold as stores of value. He also speculates on the eventual recognition of Bitcoin's value by traditional investors like Warren Buffett. In addition to Bitcoin, Scaramucci has expressed interest in other cryptocurrencies like Solana and Avalanche, although Bitcoin remains his primary focus due to its market dominance. In a recent post on the X platform, Scaramucci reacted to the latest projections from the Congressional Budget Office indicating that the U.S. federal debt will rise to 116% by 2034. This trajectory surpasses the debt levels observed during World War II, suggesting a potentially more concerning economic outlook."

4/6/2024,"Long-Dormant Bitcoin Whale Address Reactivates, Transfers 246 Bitcoins","According to BlockBeats, a Bitcoin whale address that has been dormant for over a decade has just been reactivated. The address, which begins with 1CLxm, has transferred out 246 Bitcoins. This address accumulated 1701 Bitcoins during the period of 2013-2014. At that time, the value was approximately 1.06 million USD. The current value of these Bitcoins has now exceeded 115 million USD. The reactivation of this long-dormant Bitcoin address and the subsequent transfer of a significant amount of Bitcoin has drawn attention in the cryptocurrency community. The original accumulation of these Bitcoins took place during a period of significant growth and development in the cryptocurrency market. The current value of these Bitcoins, now exceeding 115 million USD, reflects the substantial increase in the value of Bitcoin over the past decade. The reactivation of this Bitcoin whale address and the transfer of such a large amount of Bitcoin could potentially have implications for the Bitcoin market. However, the specific impact of this event is yet to be determined. It is also unclear why this Bitcoin whale address has been reactivated after remaining dormant for over a decade."

In a recent tweet, Mow highlighted the importance of a key Bitcoin indicator, noting that many short-term holders are selling their Bitcoin due to recent market developments. He referred to these sellers as 'weak-handed', while 'diamond-handed' hodlers continue to buy more of the world's first cryptocurrency. Over the past 24 hours, Bitcoin experienced a minor drop followed by a quick recovery. Prior to the drop, the leading digital currency showed a 2.56% growth. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at the $68,130 price level. Earlier this week, Mow drew parallels between spot-based Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the main character of the iconic movie 'The Matrix'. He suggested that like , who destroys Agent Smith by diving into him, Bitcoin ETFs have penetrated the traditional financial system. Without making specific predictions, Mow hinted at the possibility of Bitcoin disrupting the legacy system and potentially replacing the U.S. dollar in the future. Mow also expressed his belief that Bitcoin is on its way to hitting the $1 million price mark. He has mentioned this prediction multiple times recently, particularly in the lead-up to the upcoming Bitcoin halving event scheduled for the second half of April. According to Mow, the launch of Bitcoin ETFs has created a demand shock, as these ETFs acquired 12 times the daily Bitcoin production of miners. He believes that this demand shock, coupled with the supply shock created by the Bitcoin halving, will drive the price to unprecedented highs. However, he noted that while all ETFs are buying Bitcoin, Grayscale's GBTC continues to see significant outflows."
4/6/2024,Bitcoin Miners Face Challenges Ahead of Upcoming Halving,"According to CryptoPotato, Bitcoin miners are gearing up for the fourth Bitcoin halving, expected in about 15 days. This event will significantly reduce their block rewards, posing challenges to their profitability. Despite an increase in selling activity by some Bitcoin mining companies, they continue to grapple with issues such as lower transaction fees, heightened mining competition, and the requirement for more computing power to generate the same amount of Bitcoin ( ). The halving will cut Bitcoin block rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC, slashing miners' revenues by 50%. To maintain profitability, miners will need higher BTC prices. CryptoQuant's recent weekly crypto report showed that the mining industry's daily revenue hit record levels in 2024 due to rising BTC prices. While the current daily revenue is around $67 million, it peaked at $79 million in early March, a 3.5x increase from figures recorded in May 2020, just before the previous halving event. However, the increase in daily revenue did not reflect in the hashprice, which is 30% lower than before the last halving. The hashprice, or the average revenue a miner earns each time it attempts to find a valid block, is currently $0.11 and is expected to drop to $0.055 after the halving. In May 2020, the hashprice was around $0.16 TH/s. Additionally, the Bitcoin hashrate has increased more than five times since the previous halving, from 116 EH/s to 600 EH/s, indicating that miners need more computing power to produce the same amount of per day. Bitcoin transaction fees have also dropped 90% from a daily total of 412 BTC in mid-December 2023 to 29 BTC currently. Transaction fees now account for about 3% of the total block reward, down from 37% in mid-December 2023. To compensate for the loss of block reward, higher fees or Bitcoin prices are necessary, according to CryptoQuant analysts. These challenges have already impacted the daily production of major Bitcoin mining companies like Riot Platforms, Core Scientific, Bitfarms, and Marathon Digital. The effects of the upcoming months on these firms remain to be seen."
4/7/2024,Bitcoin's Market Capitalization Surpasses Top Four Global Banks Combined,"According to U.Today, Gabor Gurbacs, strategy advisor at Tether and VanEck, has highlighted Bitcoin's dominance over major banks. With a market capitalization exceeding $1.3 trillion, Bitcoin now surpasses the combined value of the world's top four largest banks. These include banking giants such as JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, ICBC, Wells Fargo, Agricultural Bank of China, Bank of China, and China Construction Bank. In fact, Bitcoin's market cap is 2.4 times larger than that of JPMorgan Chase alone. This achievement emphasizes the increasing importance of decentralized digital currencies in the global financial landscape. Gurbacs has challenged the narrative surrounding Bitcoin's success. He questions why journalists often overlook its achievements while focusing on its failures. He argues that Bitcoin's resilience should be compared to the perceived failures of the banking system, especially when its market cap surpasses that of the top four banks combined. Interestingly, Bitcoin's market capitalization places it among tech giants like Amazon and Meta (formerly Facebook), demonstrating its influence and relevance in the digital age. This position further cements Bitcoin's status as a powerful player in both the financial and technological sectors. Gurbacs also stresses the need for institutions, including The Fed, to recognize Bitcoin's significance. He contends that ignoring or disrespecting Bitcoin is no longer feasible given its strong presence in the financial landscape."
4/7/2024,Gold Outperforms Bitcoin Over Last Two and a Half Years,"According to U.Today, Peter Schiff has highlighted that over the past two and a half years, gold has outperformed Bitcoin. This comes as gold also outpaces the S&P 500 year-to-date, providing insight into the current economic climate. Gold's strength is attributed to its stability, making it a preferred asset for investors during times of market uncertainty. Over the past 2.5 years, gold has demonstrated consistent growth in value, solidifying its status as a robust and safe investment. In contrast, Bitcoin's journey has been significantly more volatile, with substantial peaks and troughs. This volatility presents both opportunities and extreme risk exposure. When comparing the two, gold's price has been on a steady incline, reaching approximately $2,329.57 per ounce, well above both its 50-day and 100-day exponential moving averages (EMAs), suggesting continued strength. On the other hand, Bitcoin, currently priced around $69,045, has experienced more fluctuation and is now encountering resistance at $70,000. Looking ahead, for gold to sustain its upward trend, it needs to keep support above its 50-day EMA of $2,184. Similarly, for Bitcoin to regain bullish momentum, it needs to surpass current resistance levels and maintain above the $67,316 mark. If it fails to do so, it could find support at the 50-day EMA of approximately $64,000. Bitcoin's potential for high returns attracts investors willing to embrace more uncertainty, which contrasts with gold. Gold and Bitcoin investors employ different strategies, and direct comparison may not be entirely appropriate. One presents extreme risk and volatility, while the other serves as a hedge against inflation during periods of poor economic performance."

4/7/2024,Dogecoin Co-Founder Suggests Unconventional Bitcoin Valuation,"According to U.Today, Billy Markus, co-creator of Dogecoin, recently sparked a conversation in the crypto community with his unique perspective on Bitcoin's valuation. Markus, known for his humorous and sometimes controversial opinions on digital currencies, proposed a Bitcoin price of $69,420. His reasoning? Simply because it's a number, and in his view, memes are dominant in the universe. This playful comment triggered a wave of responses from his followers, with one suggesting the figure be raised to $694,200. Markus humorously agreed to this suggestion. Interestingly, Bitcoin's price has seen a surge, coming closer to the value proposed by Markus. With a 6% increase since the start of the week, Bitcoin is now just above $69,420, only 6.4% away from potentially hitting a new high of $74,000. While Markus jokes about Bitcoin's valuation, his creation, Dogecoin, continues to gain traction. Dogecoin experienced a 5% increase, reaching $0.195 per . Markus took the opportunity to share a fun collage featuring the famous Doge , encouragingly captioned 'Go, Doge, Go!' Markus' unusual perspective on Bitcoin's value may seem humorous, but it highlights the interconnectedness of cryptocurrency and internet culture. As memes become increasingly influential in the digital world, affecting market sentiments and price forecasts, it's evident that even the most bizarre ideas can stimulate significant conversations and potentially impact market trends."

4/7/2024,"Bitcoin Exodus From Exchanges Accelerates, Signaling Potential Supply Crunch","According to U.Today, a significant amount of Bitcoin ( ) has been moved out of known crypto exchange wallets in the last month. Nearly 111,000 BTC, valued at approximately $7.55 billion, were transferred, indicating a reduction in BTC supply on exchanges. This trend suggests that more investors are choosing to store their Bitcoin in private wallets rather than on exchanges, possibly leading to a supply crunch where demand surpasses available supply. This could potentially set the stage for a bullish rally. Institutional adoption of Bitcoin has also seen a recent surge. These institutional investors may prefer to secure their holdings in private wallets or cold storage for long-term purposes. On April 4, crypto analyst Ali reported that 21,400 BTC, worth around $1.40 billion, were moved to accumulation addresses that have never spent funds in a single day. On-chain analytics firm IntoTheBlock has reported that Bitcoin ETFs have accumulated more than 4% of the supply in less than three months. The amount of Bitcoin held by addresses with 1,000 BTC or more, known as 'whales,' has dramatically increased since the inception of the ETFs. The aggregate balance of whale addresses has reached its highest point since June 2022. This year, the balance of whales has increased by 220,000 BTC, totaling $14.2 billion, with 210,000 of these BTC coming from net inflows into ETFs. This has pushed Bitcoin to new all-time highs, contributing to increased demand for crypto assets. At the time of writing, BTC was up 2.23% in the previous 24 hours to $69,286."
4/7/2024,Analyst Views Bitcoin's Dip to $50K as Unlikely Amid Increasing Support Levels,"According to Cointelegraph: Bitcoin's retracement to $50,000 seems improbable considering the cryptocurrency's recent uptrend and the lack of pronounced volatility in the derivatives market, according to Dylan LeClair, a senior analyst at UTXO Management. Bitcoin, currently priced at $69,344, has been consistently posting higher lows, signaling a potentially unbroken uptrend. Bitcoin liquidation map. Source: CoinGlass When Bitcoin climbs back into the $70,000-$75,000 price region, short positions will encounter significant pressure, as LeClair mentioned in an analyst note on April 7. If Bitcoin reaches the $70,000 mark, about $174.17 million worth shorts will be liquidated, scaling up to $830 million at $75,000; according to CoinGlass data. A fall to $50,000 would equate to a 27% decrease from Bitcoin's current price. While such a dive could trigger substantial long position liquidations, LeClair evaluated it as improbable given the current trading environment and the rising support levels. Source: Rekt Capital Backing his theory, LeClair cites BlackRock's recent move, as the global asset manager updated its Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) prospectus on April 5 to list five significant Wall Street firms as new participants. These comprise ABN AMRO Clearing, Citadel Securities, Citigroup Global Markets, Goldman Sachs, and UBS Securities. The Bitcoin community is buzzing with price speculations ahead of the halving event slated for April 20, an occurrence expected every four years that slashes miner block rewards by half. Bitcoin's price has surged about 658% since the last halving event in 2020. If the currency follows its historical pattern, the 2028 halving could see Bitcoin hit $434,280 per coin."

4/8/2024,Bitcoin Needs to Breach $80K Mark to Keep Mining Profitable After Halving,"According to Cointelegraph: Bitcoin (BTC) is significantly dependent on its pricing to make mining profitable post the upcoming halving, with its threshold set above $80,000. CryptoQuant's CEO, Ki Young Ju indicates that the costs of mining with Antminer S19 XPs will effectively double from $40,000 to $80,000 once the Bitcoin halving event transpires in mid-April. CryptoQuant CEO on the Bitcoin halving. Source: Ki Young Ju The Bitcoin halving, a milestone that slashes miners' block reward by half every 210,000 blocks or roughly every four years, majorly influences miner behavior apart from its indirect impact on BTC's price. After the May 2020 halving, the threshold at which mining remains profitable surged beyond $30,000. This elevation was echoed by BTC's price reaching a new all-time high of $69,000 in the same cycle. Average Bitcoin mining cost. Source: MacroMicro With the forthcoming halving slated for April 20, average mining costs are predicted to exceed $80,000. To ensure mining remains a profitable venture, BTC's price must surpass this level. Historical data suggests that post halving, BTC prices experience significant spikes. Following halving events in 2012, 2016, and 2020, Bitcoin showcased impressive price hikes of around 9,000%, 4,200%, and 683%, respectively. Bottom line, even amidst apprehensions, miners have managed to retain profitability post-halving events. Though there is an interim phase when the BTC price lies beneath the profitability margin for miners—the aftermath invariably records price surges that exceed average mining costs."

4/8/2024,Bitcoin Miners Face Challenges as Rewards Halve,"According to Blockworks, Bitcoin miners are bracing for a significant reduction in per-block rewards, which are set to halve from 6.25 to 3.125 later this month. This fourth halving event in the network's history could pose a significant challenge for even the most well-equipped mining firms, and potentially make the already slim profit margins of home-based miners even slimmer. The situation is straightforward for miners: if the halving increases Bitcoin's price, their investment is justified. However, if it doesn't, smaller miners could be left with idle ASICs, high energy bills, and little chance of recouping their costs. Some home-based miners have shared their concerns on the r/BitcoinMining subreddit, stating that Bitcoin would need to reach between $70,000 and $140,000 for them to break even or maintain their current profit margins post-halving. There are other factors that home-based miners need to consider beyond the price of Bitcoin. One such factor is Bitcoin's hash rate, which has been growing at an increasing rate throughout the network's history. The hash rate is essentially a measure of the competition to mine Bitcoin blocks. High electricity prices can also pose a challenge, especially as power grids in the US and elsewhere struggle to meet the demand for compute-intensive AI. Individual miners have very low odds of successfully mining Bitcoin on their own. Many choose to join mining pools, which coordinate and share rewards among several miners, while also charging varying fees. The prices of miners vary, and more-efficient ASICs are released over time. Some miners have given up hope altogether, with several forum posters suggesting that prospective miners gradually purchase Bitcoin over time, a process known as dollar cost averaging. Two miners told Blockworks that using mining rigs for home heating was one way to make home-based mining profitable. ASIC miners emit heat as they run, and some Bitcoin enthusiasts have developed ways of capturing this heat and circulating it through their homes. However, those already involved in mining are unlikely to be deterred by the halving, with many having planned for this event for some time."
4/8/2024,US Consumer Price Index Announcement Could Impact Bitcoin Performance,"According to U.Today, the United States is set to announce the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for March on April 10. The CPI, a measure of inflation, can significantly influence the Federal Reserve's decisions on interest rates. The following day, the minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in March will be released, with a high likelihood of interest rates remaining unchanged in May. Such decisions can directly or indirectly affect the performance of digital assets, particularly Bitcoin. When interest rates remain steady, it often indicates that the economy is stable enough not to require higher rates to curb inflation. For Bitcoin and other digital assets, stable interest rates could be seen as positive. Lower borrowing costs could lead to increased investment in riskier assets such as cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin's current price is around $71,539. If the news on April 10 and 11 suggests a favorable U.S. economy, Bitcoin could potentially see a boost as more investors may seek additional risk exposure. On the technical side, the key level to watch is around $67,000. If Bitcoin can maintain above this level, it might climb towards its all-time high. However, if Bitcoin cannot maintain this level, there is support at the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at around $57,757. If the Bitcoin price remains bullish and the news from the CPI and FOMC is positive or at least not negative, digital assets might see stabilization. A steady or decreasing inflation rate could lead to increased confidence in riskier investments, potentially benefiting Bitcoin."

The company has added Bitcoin ( ) worth $6.56 million to its balance sheet, resulting in a nearly 90% increase in its publicly traded stock price in Tokyo within two days. The move is aimed at reducing exposure to the yen and providing Japanese investors with an opportunity to engage with cryptocurrency under a favorable tax structure. Initially operating budget hotels under the name Red Planet, Metaplanet has since transitioned into a Web3 software developer. The company stated that this decision is intended to use Bitcoin as a means of hedging against inflation, a tool for macroeconomic stability, and a foundation for long-term capital appreciation. This strategy emulates that of MicroStrategy, a US-based company that announced in 2020 that it would begin increasing its Bitcoin holdings. Today, its stock price often reflects fluctuations in the price of Bitcoin, demonstrating investor sentiment towards the cryptocurrency market. Furthermore, Jason Fang, a partner and co-founder of Sora Ventures, emphasized that this is a way for Japanese investors to engage with cryptocurrency through publicly traded companies rather than directly holding assets, the latter of which is affected by high taxes on unrealized cryptocurrency gains."

4/9/2024,Bitcoin Price Recovery Indicates Potential New All-Time High: Technical Analysis,"According to CryptoPotato, Bitcoin's price has bounced back from the $65K mark a few days ago and is on track to set a new all-time high soon. The daily chart reveals a large symmetrical triangle pattern, with the market currently testing the upper boundary of this pattern. If the price successfully breaches the upper boundary, a rally toward the $75K level and the creation of a new all-time high could become increasingly likely. The Relative Strength Index also displays values above 50%, suggesting that the momentum is bullish and a price surge is probable. In the 4-hour timeframe, the price has recently surpassed the triangle pattern and is currently retesting the broken trendline. If a successful rebound occurs, could ascend toward the $75K and potentially higher. Conversely, a fall back inside the triangle could render the recent breakout a false one, making a decline toward the lower boundary of the pattern or even the $60K support zone more likely. As the Bitcoin price has rebounded above the $70K level, market participants are anticipating BTC to set a new all-time high soon. This optimism is reflected in the holding behavior of investors. The Net Unrealized Profit Loss (NUPL), which is the difference between market cap and realized cap divided by market cap, suggests the total amount of profit/loss in all the coins. The NUPL metric shows values above 0.5, similar to what was observed during the 2022 all-time high. While the market can still climb higher, the amount of unrealized profits can be concerning, as mass selling pressure could lead to a significant price crash."
4/9/2024,"Consumer Opinions Split on Bitcoin's Future, Survey Reveals","According to Bloomberg, a recent survey has revealed a divide in consumer opinions regarding the future of Bitcoin. The survey, which included over 3,600 participants, found that only 10% of respondents believe Bitcoin will rise above $75,000 by the end of December. This would require a significant increase from its current price, which was approximately $70,700 as of Tuesday morning in London. The survey also found that 40% of respondents are confident about Bitcoin's potential to thrive in the coming years. However, a nearly equal percentage (38%) expect the cryptocurrency to disappear. Less than 1% of respondents considered the possibility of Bitcoin dropping to a level last seen during a deep bear market in 2022, which would mean a decrease of around $50,000 from its current price. Bitcoin has seen a 67% rise this year, outperforming traditional assets. This month, Bitcoin will undergo the so-called 'halving', a four-yearly event that reduces the new supply of the token. Some investors view this as a bullish tailwind. The cryptocurrency reached an all-time high of $73,798 in mid-March. The survey results come amidst a surge of inflows into three-month-old US spot-Bitcoin. 'You’re seeing a lot of continued traction that’s coming into the market because of the upcoming halving,' one respondent commented."
4/9/2024,"Bitcoin Halving Could Lead to Unexpected Market Movements, Says Arthur Hayes","According to CryptoPotato, the cryptocurrency community is preparing for the much-anticipated Bitcoin halving, expected around April 20. However, there are differing opinions on the immediate and long-term impact of this event. Arthur Hayes recently shared his views, suggesting that while the halving might boost prices in the medium term, the asset could experience a slump both before and after the event. He stressed that while the halving is often seen as a bullish catalyst, the consensus around its positive impact could result in unexpected market movements. Hayes stated, 'When most market participants agree on a certain outcome, the opposite usually occurs.' Hayes noted that the halving coincides with a period of tighter than usual dollar liquidity, which could increase market volatility. His analysis suggests that reducing block rewards for miners and tighter dollar liquidity could lead to a 'firesale' of crypto assets, pushing prices down. In light of these potential market movements, Hayes has decided to refrain from trading until May, emphasizing the need for caution in these uncertain times. He revealed that he has already taken full profits on several positions, reallocating the proceeds into stablecoin-based investments to earn yields. Hayes also discussed the impact of Federal Reserve and Treasury policies on financial markets. He explained how troubled banks can access liquidity through facilities like the discount window, and the implications of this on market stability. He noted a discrepancy between the previous bailout program and the discount window. While the bailout program restored solvency by reimbursing losses, the discount window only provides cash equivalent to the market value of securities. Hayes suggested that the Fed could equalize treatment between the two mechanisms, effectively continuing a 'stealth banking bailout' by supporting bankrupt banks with printed money. This could increase the balance sheets of bankrupt banks, preventing market-induced bankruptcies post-bailout program expiration."

4/9/2024,Acheron Trading CEO Predicts: Bitcoin Mining May Remain Profitable Post-Halving as Network Fees Rise,"According to Cointelegraph: Contrary to past trends, the forthcoming Bitcoin halving may not necessarily result in reduced profitability for miners, says Laurent Benayoun, CEO of Acheron Trading. Despite the 50% reduction in Bitcoin supply issuance after the halving event, Benayoun suggests that increasing network fees might compensate for decreased mining rewards. Bitcoin average transaction fees chart. Source: YCharts The Bitcoin halving is scheduled to occur on April 19, cutting block issuance rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. In previous halving scenarios, smaller mining operations often exited the industry due to diminished block rewards. However, the CEO postulates that the situation would differ post-2024 halving because of the rising network fees, spurred by Ordinals inscriptions and Bitcoin-native decentralized finance, or BTCFi. Current average Bitcoin network fees, which incentivize miners to include a transaction in the next block, stand at $4.88 per transaction, down from $16.13 a month ago. However, these fees have surged over 86% in the past year. BTC/USDT, 1-day chart. Source: CoinMarketCap Joe Downie, chief marketing officer of NiceHash, affirms that Bitcoin miners would typically remain profitable if the BTC price stays above the $70,000 mark since they're profitable at a BTC price over $35,000 at the current block rewards. Factors like the quality and energy efficiency of a mining firm's equipment will also influence its profitability beyond Bitcoin's price, explains Downie. Therefore, despite the halving event, miners with newer, more energy-efficient models will likely still turn a profit. The impact of Bitcoin’s price appreciation, coupled with the increase in network fees, could mean fewer mining companies being forced out of business in the aftermath of this halving, compared to previous cycles, according to Benayoun."
4/10/2024,"Bitcoin Outperforms Gold, Says Legendary Trader Peter Brandt","According to U.Today, the ongoing debate about the rivalry between Bitcoin ( ) and gold has taken a new turn. Legendary trader Peter Brandt recently shared his insights, stating that Bitcoin has outperformed gold over the past year. For centuries, gold has been a dominant hedge against inflation and a store of value. However, its efficiency as a store of value is being questioned with the emergence of Bitcoin. While gold has shown a mild growth rate, Bitcoin has demonstrated a rapid and massive growth rate that surpasses gold on any simultaneous time frame. The BTC Gold Ratio chart, which represents the amount of gold required to buy one Bitcoin, has been steadily increasing over the past year. At the time of Brandt's post, the ratio was 29.91, up from around 20 at the start of the year. This indicates that more gold is now needed to buy the equivalent of one BTC. Despite the relevance of gold, Bitcoin brings new technical and monetary advantages that make it a more economically viable option. Unlike gold, which has an unlimited supply, Bitcoin has a maximum supply of 21 million. The upcoming Bitcoin halving event in January will trigger a defined emission of on a daily basis. These pseudo-deflationary features, along with the massive capital inflow from spot Bitcoin ETF products, are driving the price of the asset to new highs. At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s price is $70,040, down by 1.33% in 24 hours, while gold is priced at $2,354.16, down by 0.7% in the past 24 hours."

In an interview, Thielen suggested that the unsuccessful breakout could be a reflection of the tension prior to the release of the US Consumer Price Index (CPI). He noted that the Nasdaq index, dominated by tech stocks, rose on Tuesday, providing a positive signal for Bitcoin and other risk assets. In other words, Bitcoin's decline could be temporary. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics is set to release the CPI data for March 2024 later today. This information could potentially influence the performance of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Investors are advised to keep an eye on these developments as they could impact the market's direction.

This marks the lowest single-day net outflow since its conversion to a spot Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). Despite only Fidelity's FBTC and 's ARKB having released their data for the day, the overall net inflow for Bitcoin spot ETFs in the United States was recorded at $14.1 million.

Contrary to the claims of some critics, Saylor stated that 'laser eyes' is not a gimmick, but a symbol of true Bitcoiners. The 'laser eyes' trend began in 2021 when Bitcoin enthusiasts, expecting the cryptocurrency to surge to $100,000 following the halving event a year prior, added 'laser eyes' to their Twitter profile pictures. Saylor was among those who participated in this trend, along with other notable figures such as VC investor Anthony Pompliano. In a recent tweet, Saylor compared Bitcoin to a bank in cyberspace, run by incorruptible software, offering a global, affordable, simple, and secure savings account for billions of people. He also shared advice on how to 'become the money', suggesting that one needs to remember 12 digits, a reference to the private keys of a cold storage cryptocurrency wallet for holding Bitcoin.

4/10/2024,"Bitcoin's Supply Growth Rate Could Surpass Gold's After Upcoming Halving, Predicts Analyst","According to U.Today, the countdown to Bitcoin's ( ) much-anticipated halving event has started, with renowned crypto analyst Willy Woo making a significant prediction. suggests that the halving could have a substantial impact on Bitcoin's price, potentially causing it to surge dramatically. Bitcoin halving, a preprogrammed event that happens roughly every four years or after every 210,000 blocks are mined, results in the reward miners receive for verifying transactions and adding them to the blockchain being halved. This decrease in mining rewards is intended to control inflation and ensure that the total supply of BTC remains capped at 21 million coins. Woo's analysis indicates that the forthcoming halving will result in a significant decrease in Bitcoin's annual supply growth. At present, the annual supply growth rate is 1.7%. However, post-halving, this rate will be reduced to just 0.85%. To provide context, Woo noted that the annual supply growth rate of gold is 1.6%, implying that BTC will soon have a lower supply growth rate than gold. He also compared Bitcoin's supply growth rate to that of the U.S. dollar (USD), which is currently experiencing a negative growth rate of -1.7% due to inflation. He stated that the typical range for annual supply growth in fiat currencies is between 5% and 10%. When the USD supply growth reverts to this normal range, Woo predicts that Bitcoin's price will surge dramatically. The halving event is generally seen as a positive indicator for , as it slows the rate at which new coins are introduced into circulation. This scarcity is often linked with increased demand and upward pressure on prices. 's prediction of Bitcoin surging following the halving reflects the growing optimism among investors about the coin's future price trajectory. While Woo's prediction is certainly optimistic, other analysts and experts in the field have also expressed bullish sentiment about Bitcoin's prospects post-halving. Many believe that the reduced supply growth, coupled with increasing adoption and institutional interest, could propel Bitcoin to new all-time highs in the coming months."

Schiff believes that these customers, after experiencing significant losses, will seek ways to recoup their investments. He also suggests that risk disclosures may not necessarily protect these issuers from legal issues due to conflicting public and private statements. Schiff has previously described Bitcoin ETFs as 'speculative casinos,' predicting their success would be short-lived. However, these products have so far proven to be remarkably successful. Earlier this week, BlackRock's IBIT became one of the top 3% US ETFs after nearing $20 billion in assets under management (AUM). It also set a record as the fastest ETF to reach $10 billion in AUM. Last month, Bitcoin ETFs drew $111 billion in trading volume. Despite receiving criticism from his followers for his constant Bitcoin posts, Schiff defended his stance, arguing that an alternative viewpoint is necessary on a social media platform filled with Bitcoin enthusiasts. Schiff's dislike for the leading cryptocurrency dates back to 2011 when Bitcoin was valued at just $31. Despite Bitcoin now being a $1.3 trillion asset, Schiff remains unimpressed by the flagship coin. He is also pessimistic about the upcoming halving event set to occur in the coming days."

Draper believes that Bitcoin is a key hedge against the devaluation of fiat currencies. In an interview with Cointelegraph at Paris Blockchain Week, Draper referred to the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. as a significant stimulator of interest and capital investment into the Bitcoin ecosystem. He believes these investment products provide an avenue for investors who might be intimidated by self-custodying BTC and a defense against the depreciation of fiat currencies. Draper also indicated that Bitcoin's finite supply and growing usage as payment for goods and services would further attract a broader audience, particularly in contrast to fiat currencies' inflation issues and falling purchasing power. The upcoming fourth Bitcoin halving, set for April 20, is another major event with potential to impact market dynamics. Draper advises investors not to downplay the significance of this event, given its implications on supply and demand that naturally influence Bitcoin's value. Lastly, Draper reiterated his perspective that even a single-digit percentage exposure to Bitcoin can serve as an impactful hedge against looming concerns over bank failures and fiat currency devaluation."

However, as U.Today reported, it only managed to attract $3 million worth of Bitcoin on Tuesday, significantly trailing behind BlackRock's $128.7 million. A survey by Bitwise revealed that most financial advisors interested in cryptocurrency were specifically waiting for the approval of exchange-traded funds before venturing into the crypto market. Eric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, previously noted that financial advisors typically prefer not to deal with the complexities and costs associated with crypto exchanges, but are comfortable with ETF products."
4/11/2024,Hong Kong Set To Approve First Bitcoin Spot ETF This Month,"According to Foresight News, Hong Kong is reportedly on the verge of approving its first Bitcoin spot Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) this month, with an announcement expected as early as next week. This information was disclosed by an insider source. The Hong Kong branches of China Asset Management, Harvest Fund Management, and Bosera Asset Management are all on the application list.

The approval of a Bitcoin spot ETF in Hong Kong would mark a significant milestone in the acceptance and mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies in the region. This move could potentially open up new investment opportunities for both institutional and retail investors. However, the exact timeline for the approval and launch of the Bitcoin spot ETF is yet to be confirmed. The final decision will be made by the regulatory authorities in Hong Kong. The approval process is expected to be rigorous, considering the volatile nature of cryptocurrencies."

Ripple ( ) saw a 9% weekly rise in value, gaining attention ahead of its trial with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Shiba Inu ( ) also saw a 6% increase in the last seven days, with predictions of further growth supported by network activity and development updates. Bitcoin's price experienced significant turbulence in the last few days, ranging between $68,000 and $72,000. The lowest level was recorded on April 11, when the entire market dipped substantially following the latest US CPI report showing that inflation has increased more than expected. Despite this, the negative trend did not last long, with the asset's valuation rebounding above the $70K mark. Currently, the asset trades at around $70,500, representing a 7% weekly surge. Some analysts predict further gains in the near future based on important upcoming events like the BTC halving. Ripple's recorded even more substantial gains than in the past seven days, rising by 9% and briefly touching the $0.64 mark. The asset has become a major subject of interest in the crypto space. The crypto market intelligence platform, Santiment, recently outlined the top 10 digital currencies involved in the most discussions, with XRP placed in the seventh spot. The interest could be related to the approaching trial between Ripple and the US SEC, set for April 23. The legal dispute between the entities has been ongoing for over three years and is focused on XRP’s status. Shiba Inu ( ), another well-known cryptocurrency, has also returned to green territory. The price of the second-largest meme coin is up 6% on a 7-day scale, with some analysts expecting an impressive bull run in the following months. The asset’s burn rate and the advancement of its layer-2 blockchain solution, Shibarium, may also trigger a price rally. The network experienced a significant revival in terms of daily transactions this week, while the number of total blocks exceeded the 4 million milestone."
4/11/2024,VanEck CEO: Retail Investors Account for 90% of Bitcoin ETF Inflows,"According to Cointelegraph: Jan van Eck, CEO of the investment management firm VanEck, highlighted that spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are largely receiving inflows from retail investors, representing about 90% of the aggregate. Despite these ETFs inviting considerable capital since their 2024 inception, traditional banks and institutional investors are largely absent. The VanEck CEO, speaking at Paris Blockchain Week, confirmed that while Bitcoin ETFs have seen billion-dollar inflows on some occasions since launch, greatly exceeding his own expectations, traditional financial sector players have yet to make significant contributions. The lack of involvement from U.S. banks, none of which have officially sanctioned financial advisors to recommend Bitcoin, is also noteworthy, he explained. Van Eck sees potential for considerable institutional investment from banks and conventional firms in the upcoming month, although the Bitcoin ETF landscape is still in its early stages. Convenience, safety, and affordability were cited by Jan van Eck as reasons for investors choosing Bitcoin ETFs over direct purchase and management of BTC. VanEck posits that Bitcoin can substantially complement gold in investors' portfolios, acknowledging the rising influence political, economic, and technological trends have on the financial markets. While Bitcoin ETFs have undeniably left an impact on the market and the Bitcoin price appreciation in 2024, Van Eck emphasizes that Bitcoin's influence extends beyond ETFs, highlighting the significance of global and Asian markets."
4/11/2024,Robert Kiyosaki Believes Bitcoin Could Reach $2.3 Million Per Coin,"According to BlockBeats, Robert Kiyosaki, the author of 'Rich Dad Poor Dad', expressed his belief on social media on April 11 that Bitcoin could reach $2.3 million per coin. He stated, 'Cathie Wood assures that Bitcoin will reach $2.3 million per coin. Do I believe her? Yes, I do. She could be wrong. But what does that matter? The more important question is, what do you believe? Most importantly, how much Bitcoin do you own? I also believe that Bitcoin will reach $2.3 million.' Previously, BlockBeats reported that Cathie Wood, the CEO of Ark Invest, stated in March that if institutions could allocate 5% of their shares to digital currency, Bitcoin could rise to $2.3 million. Kiyosaki's statement aligns with Wood's prediction, indicating a shared optimism about the future value of Bitcoin among influential figures in the financial world."
4/11/2024,MicroStrategy's Michael Saylor Reminds Crypto Community of Upcoming Bitcoin Halving,"According to U.Today, Michael Saylor, founder of business intelligence firm MicroStrategy and the company's Bitcoin strategy leader, has issued a reminder to the cryptocurrency community about an upcoming significant Bitcoin event. Saylor, who is known for his frequent Bitcoin-related posts, recently tweeted about the impending Bitcoin halving, which is expected to take place in nine days. The Bitcoin halving is a fundamental event for Bitcoin enthusiasts and the wider crypto community. This will be the fourth halving since Bitcoin's inception in 2009. After the halving, miners' rewards per block will be reduced by half, from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC. Consequently, the total amount of Bitcoin issued per day will decrease from 900 to 450 BTC. Many cryptocurrency analysts believe that the halving will provide enough momentum for Bitcoin's price to reach a new all-time high. The last halving event in 2020 led to two historic peaks in Bitcoin's price in 2021. The first peak was largely attributed to Elon Musk and Tesla, as the company purchased $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin and added it to its balance sheet. Tesla also accepted Bitcoin as a payment option for its electric cars for several months. This year, Bitcoin reached a new all-time high on March 14, hitting the $73,750 mark. At present, Bitcoin is trading at $67,621, reflecting a 4% drop in the last hour."
4/11/2024,"Bitcoin ETF Demand Impacts Market Supply, Predicts Price Increase Post Halving","According to BlockBeats, Brian Dixon, CEO of investment firm Off the Chain Capital, stated on April 11 that the overall demand since the launch of the Bitcoin ETF has significantly impacted the market supply. He suggested that logically, once the halving occurs and the supply further decreases, the price would increase. David Lawant, Research Director at FalconX, expressed a similar view. He noted that this surge is the first time Bitcoin has broken historical highs before halving. Some are concerned that the ETF has pulled demand forward, and we may hover at the current level for some time. Anthony Anderson, founder and CEO of Param Labs and Kiraverse, also shared the same perspective. He said that since the beginning of the year, the Bitcoin ETF has preempted the impact of halving supply by acquiring a large amount of . Fred Thiel, CEO of the US-listed mining company Marathon Digital Holdings Inc., also expressed a similar view in an interview. He stated that the approval of the Bitcoin spot ETF has been a huge success, attracting funds into the market and essentially promoting the price increase that should occur three to six months after halving. This halving event will reduce the supply of Bitcoin by about 450 per day, which may have a minor impact on the price. As Bitcoin miners, we are very excited about the halving, and this time the price did not drop before the halving, but rose."
4/11/2024,"Bitcoin Still in Early to Mid Bull Market Stage, Says Ark Invest","According to BlockBeats, Ark Invest's report released on April 11th indicates that the institution believes Bitcoin's price is still in the early to mid-stage of a bull market, compared to past cycles. Furthermore, the institution is optimistic about the performance of Bitcoin's scalability solutions, such as Rollup and sidechains, in this round. They believe that since the second half of 2023, these trends have been strong due to factors such as the appreciation of Bitcoin's price, and these trends may continue in the current bullish cycle. Regarding the Consumer Price Index (CPI) data, the institution believes that the bearish impact of this CPI directly affects market liquidity and risk-bearing capacity, which could theoretically limit speculative trading activities in the crypto market. However, factors such as the upcoming halving event and the inflow of funds into the US spot Bitcoin ETF could potentially support Bitcoin's price in the short to medium term."

4/11/2024,Grayscale Predicts Rising Demand for Bitcoin Amid 'Unsustainable' Deficit and Inflation,"According to Cointelegraph: Grayscale, in its latest analysis, points out that persistent inflation and an unsustainable budget deficit are likely to stimulate the demand for store-of-value assets like Bitcoin. Amid heightened US inflation, the Federal Reserve is expected to hold interest rates at their current level for a significant period, says Zach Pandl, Grayscale's Managing Director of Research. The 10-year real interest rate. Source: Federal Reserve Bank of St.Louis Despite the potential short-term negative impact of high inflation on crypto, Pandl also identifies several factors such as booming nominal growth, Bitcoin halving, and increasing crypto adoption as catalysts that would foster a supportive environment for the crypto markets. Recent data shows that the inflation in March expanded by 0.4% month-on-month and 3.5% year-over-year, outperforming the estimates of 0.3% and 3.4% respectively from a Dow Jones economists survey. Persistent high inflation rates would limit the Fed's ability to cut interest rates, resonating with Pandl's viewpoint. Despite the potential short-term hike in the real interest rate posing as a negative, Pandl firmly believes that demand for store-of-value assets will remain consistent in the longer term. Spikes in the 10-year real interest rate in correlation with significant Bitcoin price drops have been observed at times when the rate experienced significant monthly rises. After the most recent Consumer Price Index (CPI) data release, Bitcoin did undergo a slight price downswing. However, crypto analyst Matthew Hyland notes the formation of an ascending triangle on Bitcoin's price chart, suggesting a new resistance level above $71,500."
4/11/2024,"Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Hits Record High, According to BTC.com Data","According to PANews, BTC.com data reveals that the difficulty of Bitcoin mining has reached a new historical peak. The adjustment in mining difficulty occurred at block height 838,656, dated April 11, 2024, at 05:17:33. The mining difficulty has been increased by 3.92% to 86.39 T, marking a new record. The current average network computing power stands at 629.72 EH/s. This increase in mining difficulty is a significant development in the Bitcoin mining industry. The adjustment in difficulty level is an inherent feature of the Bitcoin network, designed to maintain the average time between blocks at around ten minutes. As more miners join the network, the difficulty increases, ensuring the stability and security of the Bitcoin blockchain. The current average network computing power, or hash rate, is a measure of the processing power of the Bitcoin network. When the hash rate increases, it indicates more miners are contributing their computational power to the network, increasing its overall security. The recent increase in Bitcoin's mining difficulty and the corresponding rise in the network's hash rate underscores the growing interest and investment in Bitcoin mining."

Bitcoin’s price has hovered between $65,600 and $72,668 over the past seven days. Source: CoinMarketCap On April 10, GBTC witnessed outflows of $17.5 million, a substantial drop from the $154.9 million recorded a day earlier. In tandem, Bitcoin exhibited a 2.08% hike in the last 24 hours, with a current valuation of $70,474. The March U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) data release, which indicated a year-on-year surge of 3.5%, led to concerns that the U.S. Federal Reserve might postpone interest rate cuts. Subsequently, Bitcoin briefly dipped to local lows of $67,482. Source: Thomas Fahrer Optimism is beginning to circulate among crypto authorities that the accelerated decline in GBTC outflows, totaling $16 billion since its conversion to a spot Bitcoin ETF in January, could indicate a market slowdown. With outflows on April 10 equivalent to about 250 Bitcoin, this suggests a roughly 95% reduction from the beginning of the week. Amidst these dynamics, other Bitcoin ETFs recorded inflows, with Fidelity's Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund seeing $76.3 million, BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust gaining $33.3 million, and the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF having inflows of $7.3 million. Recently, Genesis, a bankrupt crypto lending firm, sold approximately 36 million GBTC shares to acquire 32,041 Bitcoin."
4/12/2024,"Bitcoin Network Transaction Fees Skyrocket, Possibly Due to BRC-20 Protocol Token Trading Surge","According to BlockBeats, on April 12th, Bitcoin network transaction fees have seen a significant increase, currently reaching 196 Sat/byte for medium priority. This surge may be related to a substantial increase in the trading volume of BRC-20 protocol tokens. The BRC-20 protocol is a technical standard used for smart contracts on the blockchain for implementing tokens. The increase in trading volume of these tokens could be contributing to the rise in transaction fees on the Bitcoin network. However, it is important to note that while there seems to be a correlation, further investigation is needed to confirm the exact cause of the surge in Bitcoin network transaction fees. The relationship between the trading volume of BRC-20 protocol tokens and Bitcoin transaction fees is complex and can be influenced by a variety of factors."

4/12/2024,Bitcoin's Scarcity Debunked: A Look at the Cryptocurrency's Divisibility,"According to Blockworks, despite the common belief that Bitcoin is scarce due to its supply limit of 21 million , the reality is different. The scarcity notion is challenged by the fact that each Bitcoin is highly divisible, up to eight decimal places, resulting in 100 million satoshis (sats) per Bitcoin. This divisibility makes Bitcoin far from scarce. The current circulating supply of Bitcoin, which is 19.68 million, translates to 1.968 quadrillion sats. By 2140, there will be 2.1 quadrillion sats. To put this into perspective, the base money supply of the US dollar is currently less than $5.9 trillion, and the broader M3 is under $20.8 trillion. If Bitcoin is considered scarce, then so should the US dollar. While it's true that only 21 million people can ever own one Bitcoin each, the number of Bitcoin addresses with at least one Bitcoin is slowly growing. Currently, around 1 million addresses have at least 1 . However, it's not clear how many of these addresses are owned by the same person or how many exchange accounts have million-dollar Bitcoin balances. There are also 53 million Bitcoin addresses that have one satoshi or more. If the current supply were suddenly distributed to these addresses, each would receive more than 37 million sats, equivalent to $25,500. This further challenges the notion of Bitcoin's scarcity. The perception of scarcity is attributed to the 'fiat brain', which automatically considers the largest unit when thinking about Bitcoin as a currency. However, sats are incredibly cheap right now, priced at $0.00069 each, and are often overlooked. If every sat were worth the current price of a whole Bitcoin, an even distribution would give every human alive $16.7 billion . In light of the upcoming Bitcoin halving, there is a renewed interest in the idea of pricing Bitcoin in sats, rather than whole coins. This could potentially shift the perception of Bitcoin's scarcity and provide a more accurate representation of the cryptocurrency's supply."
4/12/2024,"Bitcoin Faces Risk Of Deeper Price Correction, Warns CryptoQuant Analyst","According to CryptoPotato, a CryptoQuant analyst has warned that Bitcoin ( ) may be at risk of a significant price correction, despite the upcoming halving event. The analyst, known as Gaah, stated that the cryptocurrency market remains in a precarious position, particularly for leveraged traders. He suggested that substantial pressure could lead to a correction that would disrupt Bitcoin's current price structure. At the time of the report, open interest for Bitcoin was in the middle range, indicating a neutral sentiment among investors towards new positions. However, the price of Bitcoin remains in the region of the last top-created positions in March. The open interest range is also volatile in the upper region, suggesting potential for more liquidations from leveraged traders seeking liquidity. Gaah warned that this region is risky for traders, and any significant pressure could lead to a correction that would alter the price structure, causing Bitcoin to drop before reaching a new all-time high. Furthermore, the overall market sentiment is currently euphoric, as evidenced by the high funding rates in the Bitcoin futures market. This indicates a period of extreme greed and creates potential for a significant decline. Gaah's analysis comes as Bitcoin recovers from a drop over the past three weeks, where it fell from an all-time high of $73,700 on March 14 to less than $62,000. Earlier this week, the cryptocurrency rebounded to the $70,000 range, but has since dropped to $69,300. CryptoQuant also revealed that high demand from large Bitcoin investors is expected to drive the asset's post-halving rally, as the effects of the quadrennial event have been diminishing."

Top governments by Bitcoin holdings. Source: Arkham Arkham's newly launched dashboard features data on governments with the most significant crypto holdings. The tool enables users to view real-time balances and cryptocurrency transaction histories of various governments. As of Arkham's April 12 report, the U.S. government is the largest Bitcoin holder among the global states tracked, with approximately 212,847 BTC, valued at approximately $15 billion based on current rates. In addition to Bitcoin, the U.S. government holds roughly $200 million in Ether (ETH) and other significant stablecoins like USDC and Tether. The UK and Germany follow closely with respective Bitcoin holdings of 61,245 BTC ($4.5 billion) and 49,858 BTC (around $3.5 billion). El Salvador, the pioneering nation to legalize Bitcoin as tender in September 2021, has considerably smaller holdings, with 5,717 BTC, valued at $405 million. This innovative tool marks a notable jump in cryptocurrency assets transparency, revealing the substantial holdings by large entities like country states. Notably, the dashboard indicates that the U.S. government has continued to accumulate Bitcoin over the years, adding a minimum of 5,000 BTC since early 2023. A significant portion of the U.S. government's Bitcoin holdings is attributed to confiscations linked to the Silk Road dark web market, hacker Jimmy Zhong, and the Bitfinex crypto exchange hackers."
4/12/2024,"Bitcoin Reclaims $70,000 Mark Despite Outflows From Grayscale's BTC ETF","According to CryptoPotato, Bitcoin's price, which had slipped below $70,000, has managed to reclaim that level despite increasing outflows from Grayscale's ETF. The cryptocurrency had fallen to $64,500 a little over a week ago following reports of the US government's plans to sell more BTC. However, it began its recovery a day later and had gained around five to six thousand dollars by the end of the business week. Despite an unsuccessful attempt to surpass $70,000 on Sunday, Bitcoin managed to reach a multi-week peak of just over $72,500 on Monday. However, this surge was short-lived, and the asset began to lose traction on Tuesday and Wednesday. The more significant price decline occurred after the US CPI numbers for March were released, causing BTC to slump to $67,500. The bulls returned, propelling another leg up that resulted in Bitcoin jumping to $71,000. It has remained close to that level, but its market capitalization has slipped to just shy of $1.4 trillion. Its dominance over the altcoins, however, has increased to 50.6%. Interestingly, Bitcoin's price has remained above $70,000 even though the outflows from Grayscale's GBTC fund have accelerated once again after recent stagnation. The rising dominance means that most altcoins have suffered, with ETH slipping by about 2% to $3,520. TON and NEAR have declined the most from the larger-cap altcoins, but DOGE, ADA, , SHIB, , and DOT are also in the red. WIF has lost the most value out of the top 100 altcoins, down by 10% and sitting below $3.5. The total crypto market cap has lost around $40 billion overnight and is down to $2.750 trillion."

Glassnode pointed out that in previous frenzy phases, Bitcoin's price experienced multiple retractions of more than 10%, with most retractions being even larger, and retractions of 25% or more being quite common. However, in this cycle, since Bitcoin broke its historical high, there have only been two corrections of approximately 10%. Glassnode's analysis provides a fresh perspective on the current state of the Bitcoin market. The report's findings suggest that the current bull market may still be in its early stages, despite Bitcoin's recent record-breaking performance. This could indicate that there is still significant potential for further growth in the Bitcoin market. The report also highlights the relative stability of the current Bitcoin market, with fewer large-scale price retractions compared to previous cycles. This could be a sign of increasing maturity and stability in the Bitcoin market, which could potentially attract more investors and further fuel the ongoing bull market."
4/12/2024,Bitcoin Plummets To Week-Low Amid Renewed Risk Aversion In Global Markets,"According to Bloomberg, Bitcoin, the original digital asset, has plunged to its lowest level in a week. This drop, which saw Bitcoin fall as much as 7.5% to $65,214, was triggered by a resurgence of risk aversion in global financial markets, leading to the liquidation of bullish bets on the cryptocurrency. This is the lowest price Bitcoin has seen since April 5. Smaller tokens such as Solana and Dogecoin experienced even steeper declines, dropping around 12% and 13% respectively. The global financial world was thrown into turmoil on Friday due to a sudden increase in geopolitical risks. This resulted in a slide in stocks and a rush towards safer market corners such as bonds and the dollar. Concurrently, oil prices rallied. Traders who were hoping to profit from the recent rally saw about $417 million in long liquidation of derivatives positions in the past hour, as per data from Coinglass. The liquidation in the past four and 12 hours were $663.9 million and $751 million in long positions, respectively. Total liquidations amounted to $847.6 million. This sudden downturn followed a period of rising Bitcoin prices, partly driven by Bitcoin halving. This code update has been viewed as a positive market catalyst as it reduces the supply of the digital asset. Despite the recent drop, Bitcoin is still up around 60% this year."

Over the past few months, miners have been steadily accumulating BTC stocks, leading to an imbalance in supply and demand and driving up the price of Bitcoin. As written two months ago, Bitcoin often bounces back by +32% entering the halving. However, the act of miners selling off $5 billion worth of BTC after the halving could disrupt the market for the next 4-6 months. Similar to the price consolidation of Bitcoin after previous halvings, this sell-off pressure could also lead to a similar market reaction.

4/12/2024,Bitcoin Market Shows Signs of Nervousness Ahead of Code Adjustment,"According to Bloomberg, speculators are showing signs of nervousness ahead of a once-every-four-years Bitcoin code adjustment, which has historically been bullish for the cryptocurrency. The implied volatility for Bitcoin options saw a significant increase last weekend, reversing a downward trend observed in the previous week. Bitcoin's price experienced a more than 8% range swing on Friday, causing a stir among investors. Implied volatility on contracts set to expire in the next two weeks has seen the most significant increase, jumping from 59% to 71% in just two days. This suggests that expectations for near-term volatility are on the rise. Traders, uncertain but willing to pay more for options, are likely seeking protection against price swings. This has led to potentially high premiums for downward protection. Since the approval of US exchange-traded funds to hold Bitcoin in January, the cryptocurrency's price has mostly surged. However, in the past month, the price has fluctuated within a range. Traders are now focusing on the upcoming 'halving' event, scheduled for around April 20. This event will see the rewards that miners receive for verifying transactions on the blockchain cut in half, effectively reducing the supply of additional tokens. Bartosz Lipinski, founder and CEO of Cube Exchange, believes the spike in Bitcoin expiries is related to people betting on the demand for Bitcoin on the day of the halving. He suggests that the reduced supply will make Bitcoin more expensive. This event is unique in Bitcoin's history as it creates pressure on an already inelastic price. Previous halvings have shown mixed short-term impacts, while the long-term effects have been bullish. However, Kaiko, a data analytics firm, cautions that a sample size of three is not necessarily large enough to draw definitive conclusions. They also note that other bullish events in the industry have contributed to the gains."

4/12/2024,Financial Educator Robert Kiyosaki Supports Ark Invest's $2.3M Bitcoin Prediction,"According to CryptoPotato, Robert Kiyosaki, a renowned American author and financial educator, has expressed his support for the $2.3 million Bitcoin ( ) prediction made by Cathie Wood's asset management firm, Ark Invest, earlier this year. Kiyosaki stated in a tweet that he trusts Wood's predictions due to her intelligence and the potential of BTC to reach such a value under favorable conditions. In February, Ark Invest published a research report detailing the potential impact of institutional investments and allocations from the global $250 trillion investable asset base on Bitcoin's price. The report suggested that a 1% allocation from this asset base could drive BTC's price to $120,000. Similarly, a 4.8% average maximum Sharpe ratio allocation from 2015 to 2023 could position BTC at $550,000, while a 19.4% allocation could propel the cryptocurrency to $2.3 million. While Kiyosaki agrees with 's predictions, he acknowledged that the firm's analysis might be incorrect. However, he emphasized the importance of individual ownership and perception of . If Ark's predictions materialize, Kiyosaki stated he would regret not purchasing more BTC. Conversely, if Ark's predictions prove incorrect, he would be content with not owning any BTC. Regardless of Ark's accuracy, Kiyosaki asserted that many people would not own any Bitcoins. Kiyosaki also expressed his belief that BTC could reach $2.3 million. He argued that predictions like Wood's stem from the courage to make and learn from mistakes. He encouraged his followers to 'live dangerously' and buy a small amount of BTC, regardless of whether Ark's predictions come true, as it would make them more knowledgeable and wiser. Wood, on the other hand, is confident that will be worth $1.5 million by 2030. She believes that BTC reaching $2.3 million is a question of when, not if."

4/13/2024,Countdown Begins For The Fourth Bitcoin Halving Event,"According to BlockBeats, the fourth Bitcoin halving event is approximately seven days away, with 1,044 blocks remaining. The anticipated date for this event is April 20th, 2024. The term 'halving' refers to the process of decreasing the quantity of cryptocurrency generated per unit of time, primarily accomplished by reducing block rewards. The Bitcoin network has already experienced three such halvings in the past, specifically in the years 2012, 2016, and 2020. The halving process is a significant event in the cryptocurrency world as it directly impacts the rate at which new Bitcoins are created. This event occurs approximately every four years, or after 210,000 blocks have been mined. The upcoming halving event is expected to further decrease the rate at which new Bitcoins are created, thereby potentially influencing the overall market dynamics of Bitcoin. The previous halvings have had a significant impact on the Bitcoin market, with each event followed by a substantial increase in Bitcoin's price. However, it is important to note that past performance is not indicative of future results, and the impact of the upcoming halving on Bitcoin's price remains to be seen. As the date of the fourth halving approaches, the cryptocurrency community is closely monitoring the situation and its potential implications for the Bitcoin market."
4/13/2024,FBI Subpoenas Personal Information From Bitcoin Event Attendees Amid Theft Allegations,"According to CryptoPotato, the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has issued a subpoena to gather personal information from attendees of a Bitcoin core developer event in 2022. The subpoena is linked to allegations made by developer and co-founder of mining pool, Luke Dashjr, about the theft of over 200 BTC in a hack. Mike Schmidt, co-founder of the Bitcoin non-profit Brink, revealed that he received the FBI subpoena as part of the investigation into Dashjr’s claim. The subpoena specifically requested details about attendees of the October 2022 CoreDev Atlanta event, which occurred just before TABConf 2022. It asked for the first and last names, GitHub usernames, and email addresses of the attendees, with the aim of investigating Dashjr’s allegation. Despite a confidentiality provision that expired a year later, Schmidt complied with the demand on the advice of legal counsel. Schmidt criticized Dashjr for not adequately protecting his own Bitcoin holdings. By publicly announcing the theft of his Bitcoin, Dashjr inadvertently subjected conference attendees to FBI scrutiny, leading to their personal information being disclosed to the authorities. Dashjr revealed that his funds were stolen due to a Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) key compromise on December 31st, 2022. PGP is a data encryption and decryption program that provides cryptographic privacy and authentication for data communication. At the time, the stolen was valued at around $3.3 million. However, due to market recovery and the subsequent price surge due to spot Bitcoin ETFs and the upcoming halving event, the stash would now be worth over $14 million."
4/13/2024,Major Outflow Predicted for Bitcoin Spot ETFs Following US Stock Market Open on April 15,"According to an analysis from Ember Monitoring, a substantial net outflow of approximately 824 BTC is expected from Bitcoin spot ETF custody addresses following the opening of the U.S. stock market on April 15. Reportedly, on-chain analytics point to a net outflow of $83.45 million from BTC spot ETFs in five days this week, aligning with the retracement of Bitcoin's price from $72,000 to $67,000 presenting a correction rate of 7%. On April 12 alone, eleven BTC spot ETFs saw a net outflow of $55.06 million, underscoring the expected movement of 824 BTC from the ETF custody address post the U.S. stock market opening on April 15. Specifically, Grayscale (GBTC) experienced an outflow of approximately 2,486 BTC, equating to an outflow of $166.21 million on April 12. In contrast, BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) posted an inflow of circa 1,662 BTC, translating to an inflow of $111.15 million on the same day. Currently, the combined holdings of the eleven BTC spot ETFs amount to 841,806 BTC, valued at around $56.29 billion.

4/13/2024,Bitcoin's Market Cap Could Reach $3 Trillion Post-Halving,"According to CryptoPotato, Bitcoin's market capitalization may reach $3 trillion following the upcoming halving event. This projection is based on several factors, including the asset's recent impressive price performance and industry growth expectations. Bitcoin's market cap recently hit an all-time high of over $1.43 trillion and currently stands at around $1.32 trillion. ChatGPT, a popular chatbot, suggested that reaching the $3 trillion milestone is possible, but it depends on various factors, including the impact of the halving event. Historically, halving has been a precursor to a Bitcoin bull run. However, this time the situation seems different as the price of the cryptocurrency started rallying months before the event. Fred Thiel, CEO of Marathon Digital, believes the rally influenced by the event has already been priced in and does not anticipate significant surges in the near future. Despite this, many remain bullish, predicting record peaks for Bitcoin's valuation post-halving. Robert Kiyosaki, author of the best-seller 'Rich Dad, Poor Dad', predicted that the asset could reach the $100K mark by September this year. ChatGPT also highlighted that future market dynamics, including institutional adoption, regulatory environments, and macroeconomic elements, will play a role in Bitcoin's market cap. It emphasized that a surge to $3 trillion will only be possible if positive investor sentiment is maintained. Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple, recently predicted a bright future for the cryptocurrency industry. He believes the global market capitalization of the sector may exceed $5 trillion this year. Given that Bitcoin currently accounts for approximately 50% of the total share, this could mean a future market cap of more than $2.5 trillion."
4/13/2024,Mysterious Transfer of $351 Million Worth of Bitcoin Sparks Interest,"According to U.Today, a mysterious transfer of 5,000 Bitcoin ( ), equivalent to approximately $351 million, between unknown wallets has piqued interest in the cryptocurrency industry. The transaction involved a Bitcoin whale, a term used to describe holders of large amounts of cryptocurrency, who moved the substantial sum to another whale's wallet. The true motive behind the transfer remains unknown, leading to speculation whether it's a prelude to a larger market development, a routine transfer, or an over-the-counter (OTC) transaction that occurs outside of a crypto exchange. CryptoQuant CEO, Ki Young Ju, has drawn attention to Bitcoin accumulation by whales, noting that BTC whales do not appear to be selling. This recent move adds to the ongoing speculation that Bitcoin whales are accumulating more BTC rather than selling. Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, seems stable, trading above $70,500. Traders anticipate considerable price stability for Bitcoin in the next few weeks of April, especially in light of the upcoming halving event. Between April 18 and April 21, BTC mining rewards will be reduced to 3.125 Bitcoins from 6.25 BTC. Halving, a technical event that occurs on the Bitcoin network approximately every four years, reduces the cryptocurrency's supply by half, resulting in scarcity. Historically, it marks the start of a new cycle and bull run. However, this halving is unique as Bitcoin has already surpassed the high of the previous cycle, which has never happened before to this halving event, making forecasting the length of this cycle considerably more challenging."

4/14/2024,Bitcoin Startups Witnessed a Fourfold Increase in Funding in 2023,"According to CryptoPotato, despite a general decline in venture capital activity, Bitcoin startups saw a significant increase in funding in 2023. A report by Trammell Venture Partners (TVP) revealed that the number of Bitcoin-native pre-seed deals increased by 360% last year, while the number of funded Bitcoin companies rose by 56.9%. A Bitcoin native company is defined as a firm whose product's success is closely tied to the Bitcoin network's success. These companies are founded on the belief that Bitcoin is the future global monetary asset. This category includes early-stage startups but excludes late-stage firms, Bitcoin miners, and crypto-oriented companies. Although the total amount of Bitcoin venture dollars invested decreased by 12.5% to $305 million in 2023, the number of Bitcoin venture deals increased by 69.2%. In comparison, the equivalent numbers for the crypto industry were -64.5% and -35.3%, respectively. Crypto venture deals still outnumber Bitcoin ones by about 20:1, but the increase in the latter last year was significant. Some of the major investors last year included General Catalyst, Y Combinator, and Draper Associates, the early-stage VC firm run by Bitcoin enthusiast Tim Draper. Despite 2023 being a challenging year for the broader venture capital landscape, the Bitcoin-native sector not only survived the storm but emerged stronger. The increase in funding coincided with a revival of developer activity on Bitcoin over the past year, sparked by new technological capabilities discovered on the network. These include the NFT protocol Ordinals, the Bitcoin computing paradigm BitVM, and the upcoming 'Runes' protocol, which will allow for efficient tokens to be issued on Bitcoin. The surge in Ordinals activity and the average cost to transact on Bitcoin has led to more developers seeking ways to build more effective Bitcoin layer 2 solutions to enable more efficient transfers. CoinMetrics co-founder Nic Carter stated on Friday that he has never seen more Bitcoin startups in his career, and the pace is currently at least an order of magnitude greater than it has ever been."

Yet analysts consider this a typical market fluctuation, despite the escalating geopolitical unrest in the Middle East. Bitcoin’s price has gone right down to $60,919 in the past 24 hours. Source: CoinMarketCap Bitcoin's price dipped to $60,919 before finding support at $62,060 on April 13. Its current price stands at $63,858, according to CoinMarketCap data. Such a rapid price drop inevitably led to sizeable liquidations from leveraged positions on Bitcoin. Using CoinGlass data, those liquidations amount to $319.15 million in the past 24 hours, including $256.58 million from long positions and $62.58 million from short ones. A total of $319.15 million was liquidated in Bitcoin positions over the past 24 hours. Source: CoinGlass Despite traders preparing for additional declines, a reversion in Bitcoin's price to its $67,000 level from just 24 hours ago would risk the liquidation of short positions totaling $1.05 billion. Moreover, the broader cryptocurrency market equally felt the blow, as $945.9 million was liquidated from 253,554 traders over the last 24 hours. Consequently, the Crypto Fear and Greed Index displayed a slight decrease to a greed level of 72. In conclusion, while the dip in Bitcoin has triggered substantial losses, many analysts perceive it as a usual market retrace in the crypto ecosystem, often fueled by events such as geopolitical tension or significant market indicators.

This represents a 24-hour decrease of 4.82%. Despite the short-term decline, the cryptocurrency quickly recovered its losses, demonstrating the volatile nature of the digital currency market. Bitcoin's quick recovery from this dip is indicative of the resilience of the cryptocurrency, which continues to attract investors despite its inherent volatility. The 24-hour decrease of 4.82% is a reminder of the risks associated with investing in digital currencies, but the subsequent recovery also highlights the potential for high returns. It's important for investors to keep in mind that while Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies can offer significant returns, they also come with a high level of risk due to their volatility. As such, potential investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance before entering the cryptocurrency market."

Many are expecting BTC to skyrocket after this event, with altcoins expected to follow suit."
4/14/2024,Bitcoin Layer 2 Solutions Face Criticism Over Technical Drawbacks,"According to CryptoPotato, Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions have been under scrutiny this year, despite gaining significant traction. Mempool founder Mononaut has been particularly critical, highlighting several technical drawbacks. His views have been supported by Bitcoin Ordinals founder Casey Rodarmor. Bitcoin Layer 2 networks are secondary protocols built on the Bitcoin blockchain, designed to improve scalability and transaction efficiency. They achieve this by offloading transactions from the main blockchain, which results in faster transaction processing, decreased congestion, and lower fees across the Bitcoin network. Layer 2s also allow developers to integrate smart contract functionalities on the blockchain, thereby extending the protocol's capabilities. However, Mononaut has identified several issues with these implementations. He argued that if a Bitcoin Layer 2 solution lacks support for unilateral exit, it functions more as a multi-signature system than a true Layer 2 solution. He also criticized Layer 2 solutions that involve venture capital investors and introduce their own tokens, likening them to pump and dump schemes. He further warned against Layer 2s backed by upgradeable Ethereum contracts and controlled by a single entity, viewing them as potential rug pulls. Mononaut also cautioned against solutions that incentivize locking up coins for extended periods, comparing them to previous scams such as Hex 3.0. He criticized solutions that claim to be Bitcoin-native but are actually Ethereum multi-signature systems, labeling them as affinity scams. He also highlighted the danger of systems that lack comprehensive technical documentation, comparing them to the infamous Bitconnect scam. Despite the criticism, prominent Bitcoin educator Dan Held, a vocal proponent of Layer 2s on Bitcoin, expects an explosion of such solutions as the bull run unfolds. In an interview with CryptoQuant, Held acknowledged the inefficiencies of existing Layer 2s, such as Lightning Network, Liquid, and Rootstock, but still believes that the latest resurgence could pave the way for many new players. He anticipates a variety of different Ethereum L2s, with no single winner taking all, and expects a significant increase in Bitcoin L2s."

4/15/2024,US Spot Bitcoin ETFs Experience Net Outflows,"According to Blockworks, US spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) experienced net outflows last week, a rare event that has only occurred twice since these funds were launched three months ago. The 11-fund category lost $83 million in assets from April 8 to April 12, a significant decrease from the net inflows of $485 million the previous week. Since January 11, spot bitcoin ETFs have collectively received $12.5 billion in positive flows. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC) was the only US fund to consistently see outflows, with $767 million leaving last week. The negative net flows of GBTC were not fully offset by the asset-gathering leaders, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), which brought in $487 million and $90 million, respectively. The bitcoin fund segment has only seen two weeks of net outflows prior to last week, losing $417 million in assets from January 22 to January 26 and $888 million from March 18 to March 22. The highest net inflows in a week for the category reached $2.5 billion from March 11 to March 15. The recent outflows occurred during a week when bitcoin’s price fell approximately 5% to $65,650 by Friday and dipped below $62,000 on Saturday. Matteo Greco, a research analyst at Fineqia, suggested that the net money leaving US spot bitcoin ETFs indicates 'increased profit-taking and investor caution' following the strong uptrend over the last two quarters. Trading volumes into the funds were about average last week, standing at about $3.2 billion per day. James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares, noted in a Monday report that investors appear hesitant as the positive price momentum has stalled. Bitcoin’s price reached an all-time high above $73,500 on March 14 and was above $72,000 as recently as April 8. The asset’s price was around $66,200 at 7:30 am ET on Monday, down about 4.5% from a week ago. Butterfill added that ETF activity dropped relative to the overall market, from 40% of total volumes on trusted exchanges over the last month to 31% last week, demonstrating this caution among investors."
4/15/2024,"Bitcoin's Flash Crash To $61,000 Sparks Debate Over Its Comparison To Gold","According to U.Today, Bitcoin recently underwent a flash crash, dropping to just above the $61,000 mark. This price is equivalent to approximately 26 ounces of gold, according to Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff. Schiff pointed out that two and a half years ago, one Bitcoin was equivalent to 37 ounces of gold. He views this 30% decrease as a clear indication of Bitcoin entering a bear market, especially when compared to the traditional safe-haven asset, gold. Schiff's past suggestions to choose gold over Bitcoin when the latter was trading below the $20,000 level have faced criticism. This is particularly true as Bitcoin's price, despite its volatility, is currently around the $65,000 level. Presently, the price of the digital gold is hovering above the crucial support level represented by the 200-day moving average, near $49,800. If Bitcoin's price remains above this line, it could suggest continued confidence among investors and a potential rebound. Resistance is seen around the $67,300 level. If this level is broken, it could negate the bearish sentiment and indicate a possible bullish reversal. In terms of growth scenarios, consolidation above the $61,000 level followed by a sustained push above the $67,300 resistance could see Bitcoin regain its upward momentum. Such a move would be key to challenging the bearish perspective and may suggest that Bitcoin's price in gold terms is not the only indicator of its market health. However, the comparison between Bitcoin and gold is more intricate than it may seem, as both assets serve different functions and respond differently to the market. Gold is more of a traditional safe haven asset, while Bitcoin offers more risk exposure and acts as a digital store of value."
4/15/2024,Could Bitcoin Reach $70K by Next Halving Amid Ongoing Volatility? 5 Key BTC Trends This Week,"According to Cointelegraph: This week in Bitcoin features significant price volatility, as macro pressures intersect with the upcoming Bitcoin halving. After a sharp 15% price plunge, BTC faces an uphill battle to recover lost ground. However, despite a rough weekend, Bitcoin displays resilience as it starts bouncing back. 1. Bitcoin Bulls Rally After a Sudden Dive to $61,000: A wave of geopolitical instability in the Middle East sparked immediate losses in the crypto market, resulting in BTC dropping to lows slightly above $61,000. Despite this, BTC has started a slow recovery process, with its market dominance hitting three-year highs last week. BTC/USD 1-hour chart. Source: TradingView 2.

Hong Kong Approves Spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs: Regulators in Hong Kong reportedly gave the green light for Bitcoin and Ether ETFs, a move anticipated to increase Chinese participation in these assets. However, how these spot Bitcoin ETFs will react to the weekend's volatility remains to be seen. 5. Greed Still Dominates Crypto Sentiment: Even with the recent market turbulence, crypto sentiment remains largely ""greedy,"" according to the Crypto Fear & Greed Index. Despite a slight dip to 72, it's far from a capitulatory move and is back rising towards its ""extreme greed"" zone."
4/15/2024,10x Research Analyst: Bitcoin Miners May Unload $5 Billion in BTC Post-Halving,"According to Cointelegraph: As per an analysis by Markus Thielen, head of research at 10x Research, Bitcoin miners might liquidate up to $5 billion worth of BTC in the months following the upcoming Bitcoin halving event, as seen in previous cycles. BTC post-2020 halving prices. Source: 10x Research The Bitcoin halving is an event where the reward for mining new blocks is halved, occurring every 210,000 blocks. This event takes place approximately every four years, with the upcoming halving expected around April 20. Thielen anticipates that the selling may last for four to six months and could result in a supply/demand imbalance. It is this imbalance that could lead to a BTC rally, similar to previous patterns witnessed post-halving. Marathon pre-halving accumulation. Source: 10x Research Historically, Bitcoin prices often stabilize in the months following a halving. For instance, BTC prices remained between $9,000 and $11,500 in the five months after the 2020 halving. Thus, according to Thielen, we might not see a significant upward trajectory in the market till around October this year. This could specifically impact altcoins, many of which have seen a substantial drop over the past week, and most of which are still significantly below their 2021 peaks. Thielen points out a key player who may exercise this strategy—Marathon, the world's largest Bitcoin miner. Marathon has allegedly built an inventory that will gradually be sold post-halving to prevent a sudden decline in revenue. Thielen estimates that if all Bitcoin miners adopt a similar strategy, it could result in up to $104 million worth of BTC sold per day, counteracting the supply-demand imbalance that fueled the pre-halving BTC rally. Interestingly, Peter Thiel, CEO of Marathon, estimates the breakeven point at around $46,000 per BTC for the company to remain profitable post-halving. He predicts that there will not be any significant price movements in the six months following the halving."

4/15/2024,Bitcoin Miners Face Potential $10 Billion Loss Due to Upcoming Halving Event,"According to U.Today, Bitcoin miners are potentially facing losses exceeding $10 billion due to the imminent halving event, scheduled to occur in less than five days. The immediate reward for mining new blocks will be cut from 6.25 to just 3.125 BTC per block. This halving is predicted to hit mining companies with above-average operational costs particularly hard. Historically, miners have managed to recover from the impact of block reward reductions due to the bull runs that followed each halving. As observed by Chainalysis, miners were actively building cash liquidity on the brink of the first two halvings in 2012 and 2016. However, this was not the case leading up to the third halving in 2020. Based on Bitcoin's performance following the two previous mining cycles, miners delayed liquidating their reserves as they anticipated higher prices. This time, the aggregate balance of mining pools has also decreased by over 20%, but the decline is significantly smaller compared to the first two halvings. The fact that Bitcoin's price managed to reach a new all-time high on the brink of halving allowed miners to feel more comfortable liquidating some holdings to prepare for the severe impact of the halving. In addition to the Bitcoin halving, miners also face increasing competition from artificial intelligence (AI) companies. Core Scientific CEO Adam Sullivan noted that power has become 'extraordinarily constrained' in the US. Tech giants like Amazon are willing to invest substantial amounts of money in data centers, making it more challenging for miners to secure new low-cost power contracts."
4/15/2024,Long-Dormant Bitcoin Address Suddenly Activates After 14 Years,"According to PANews, a Bitcoin address that had been dormant for 14 years suddenly activated on April 15. The address contained 50 Bitcoins, which, based on the current market price, are valued at approximately $331.4 million. The activity was detected by WhaleAlert, a blockchain monitoring service. The sudden activation of such a long-dormant address is a rare occurrence in the cryptocurrency world. The Bitcoins in the address have remained untouched for over a decade, making this a significant event in the digital currency sphere. The value of the Bitcoins in the address has significantly increased over the years due to the rise in the market price of the cryptocurrency."
4/15/2024,Bitcoin Advocate Samson Mow Remains Optimistic Despite Market Turbulence,"According to U.Today, despite the recent turbulence in the cryptocurrency market, Samson Mow, a prominent proponent of the '$1 million for Bitcoin' theory, remains optimistic about Bitcoin's future. His confidence in the cryptocurrency remains unshaken even after a sharp decline in Bitcoin's price, triggered by geopolitical tensions. Mow maintains a bullish stance, expressing his belief that Bitcoin has strong potential for future growth. The recent market downturn saw Bitcoin lose nearly 14% of its value, reaching a low of $60,660, its lowest level in almost a month. Altcoins experienced even greater losses, with the TOTAL 2 index indicating a 22% decrease in total capitalization, equivalent to approximately $250 billion. Despite these losses, Mow's confidence in Bitcoin remains steadfast. He continues to assert his bullish stance on the flagship cryptocurrency, even in the face of the recent market downturn. In the aftermath of this market upheaval, Mow's perspective offers a counterbalance to the prevailing sentiment of uncertainty and panic. As Bitcoin begins to recover, currently trading at $63,950 and showing a 5.22% increase from its recent low, Mow's optimism appears to be grounded in the currency's resilience. However, looming on the horizon is the impending Bitcoin halving, scheduled to occur in just five days. This event adds an additional layer of uncertainty to the market, prompting speculation about its potential impact on Bitcoin's price trajectory. While Mow's bullish stance may provide reassurance to some investors, the broader market remains cautious as it navigates through this period of volatility."
4/15/2024,Hong Kong's Bitcoin ETF Inflows Predicted to be a Fraction of US Levels,"According to Foresight News, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas has predicted that the inflow of funds into Hong Kong's Bitcoin ETF may only amount to $500 million. This figure is less than one-thirtieth of the current inflow into Bitcoin ETFs in the United States. The prediction is based on the relatively small size of the Hong Kong ETF market. Furthermore, the three approved issuers in Hong Kong are not as large as institutions like BlackRock, which could result in comparatively higher transaction costs."
4/15/2024,Bitcoin Dominates: Only Six Top 50 Altcoins Outperforming BTC in 2024,"According to Cointelegraph: Bitcoin's growth has dominated the crypto world so far this year, with only six out of the top 50 altcoins outperforming it. This enforces a three-year high in Bitcoin dominance over the weekend. Bitcoin dominance reached its highest level on April 14. Source: TradingView Dogecoin emerges as the top-performing altcoin among the top 50, boasting year-to-date gains of over 77%. Also outperforming Bitcoin are Shiba Inu, Stacks, Binance's BNB, Ethereum layer-2 network Mantle (MNT), and GPU-sharing blockchain network Render (RNDR). Bitcoin's price rose from $44,100 on January 1 to $65,000 currently, marking a 54% boost year-to-date. This steady increase can be linked to persistent institutional inflows into the ten US-traded spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) which got approval in January this year, receiving over $12 billion in total net inflows. Interestingly, Bitcoin dominance attained a three-year high of 56.5% on April 13, despite the market-wide sell-off induced by escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. On the other hand, a majority of smaller altcoins haven't been able to recover, experiencing significant price drops. Notable losses have been seen by Alternative layer-1 network Aptos (APT) and decentralized crypto exchange Uniswap, losing 35% and 31% respectively over the past week. Despite recent dampened sentiments surrounding risk assets, IG Market analyst Tony Sycamore expects Bitcoin to gradually reach around $80,000 in the coming months, given it can maintain above its significant support mark."
4/15/2024,"Bitcoin Recovers After $10,000 Drop, Shiba Inu's Shibarium Network Sees Increased Activity, XRP Predicted to Rise","According to CryptoPotato, Bitcoin's price experienced a significant drop of $10,000, potentially due to the prospect of US rate hikes and geopolitical tensions. However, the cryptocurrency is showing signs of recovery, with an expected boost from the upcoming halving event. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu's Shibarium network has seen a substantial increase in daily transactions, indicating increased activity and potential for future growth. Despite a recent price drop, analysts remain optimistic about , viewing the current situation as a buying opportunity with expectations for an upward trend. Bitcoin was valued at over $72K last week, but over the weekend, it fell below the $63K mark. This severe correction may have been triggered by external events impacting traditional finance. For instance, the US Federal Reserve hinted at a potential rate hike due to persistent inflation in the world's largest economy. Additionally, geopolitical tensions increased following Iran's launch of over 300 drones and missiles at Israel. Bitcoin's price was negatively affected by geopolitical concerns earlier in 2022 when Russia invaded Ukraine. However, the asset recovered all losses within days, raising hopes for a similar recovery soon. As of April 15, Bitcoin has risen by 3% and crossed the $66,000 level. The upcoming halving event, which occurs approximately every four years and halves the rewards distributed to miners for validating blocks on the Bitcoin blockchain, could potentially lead to a more significant uptick. Shiba Inu's valuation has also significantly dropped in recent days, but metrics related to its ecosystem have increased. Daily transactions on the layer-2 blockchain solution, Shibarium, surpassed 200,000 at the end of last week, a 4,000% spike compared to the previous day. The figure stands at over 400,000 as of April 15, indicating increased activity on the network. Shibarium's progress is seen as a crucial factor that could trigger a bull run for the second-largest meme coin. Ripple's native token, , dipped by around 13% on a weekly scale, briefly falling below the $0.50 mark. However, many analysts remain unfazed, with some viewing this as an ideal buy-the-dip opportunity. Some predict that XRP has reached a 'bouncing point' and forecast that it will appreciate against Bitcoin very soon. Others assume that XRP could soon climb to an all-time high of $4."

However, a proper bullish environment will still take several weeks. The impending Bitcoin halving and the longer Bitcoin hovers near its historical high prices, the more coins are exchanged among investors. This could form a long-term support once a breakthrough occurs. If liquidated at a lower price, breaking the support of $59,000, a bear market could ensue.

4/15/2024,Grayscale GBTC Sees Net Outflow of Approximately $110 Million,"According to BlockBeats, on April 16th, data from Farside Investors revealed that Grayscale's GBTC experienced a net outflow of approximately $110 million. This significant financial movement indicates a shift in investor behavior towards the digital asset investment product. Grayscale's GBTC, a popular investment vehicle for institutional and retail investors, allows exposure to Bitcoin without the need to directly own the cryptocurrency. The recent net outflow suggests a decrease in demand for this product, which could potentially impact its market value. However, it's important to note that fluctuations in inflows and outflows are common in the investment world and do not necessarily indicate a long-term trend. Investors and market watchers will be closely monitoring the situation to determine if this is a temporary shift or a sign of a broader change in the digital asset market."

4/15/2024,"Bitcoin's 'End Run' Completed, Suggests Veteran Trader Peter Brandt","According to U.Today, Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization, experienced a significant drop over the weekend, reaching lows of $60,822 before partially recovering to approximately $64,438. The exact reason for the market downturn remains uncertain, but some speculate that reduced liquidity may have contributed to the lower prices. In response to the market crash, seasoned trader Peter Brandt offered his perspective, suggesting that Bitcoin has completed an 'end run'. The term 'end run' typically refers to a strategic move that involves bypassing a challenge or obstacle. In the context of Bitcoin, it could suggest that the market has navigated a difficult situation due to its price crash near $60,000. Brandt's 'end run' comment might also hint at the completion of a specific pattern in Bitcoin's price movement. Brandt identified a pattern in the Bitcoin chart that resembles a symmetrical triangle pattern. This pattern usually indicates a period of consolidation before the price is compelled to break out or down. A breakdown from the lower trend line signals the beginning of a new bearish trend, while a breakout from the higher trend line signifies the start of a new bullish trend. In the chart, Brandt referred to the breakdown from this pattern as the 'end run'. Previously, Brandt had predicted that Bitcoin's bull run would peak at $200,000 by August or September 2025, revising his initial forecast of $120,000. His recent remarks might suggest that the recent price drop is a healthy correction within a larger positive trend, possibly indicating a sense of completion and readiness for the next phase of Bitcoin's price movement. However, without additional details, Brandt's assertion of the 'end run' being completed remains subject to interpretation."

The halving will see Bitcoin block rewards reduced from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC.

China, a known powerhouse in Bitcoin mining, is also making strides towards greener Bitcoin mining even in the face of a nationwide ban on the activity.

4/16/2024,Bitcoin Analyst Predicts BTC to Outperform Gold Market Cap,"According to U.Today, Bitcoin analyst Willy Woo has made a bold prediction that Bitcoin will surpass the gold market cap once ETFs have completed their role. suggests that the recently launched Bitcoin ETFs could potentially bring Bitcoin price targets to $91,000 at the bear market bottom and $650,000 at the bull market top. These targets, however, may not be achievable in this cycle due to the lengthy process of capital deployments. Woo's forecast is based on the assumption that the $100 trillion managed by asset managers typically has a 2% allocation recommendation. This would result in an estimated $2 trillion potential allocation into Bitcoin, a figure that Woo believes could increase over time. Currently, Bitcoin holds $561,159,959 of investment, according to on-chain data. An inflow of $2 trillion would raise this amount to over $2.56 trillion. Using the MVRV to calculate market cap versus money invested, which is a ratio of 5x in bull market tops and 0.7x in bear market bottoms, this would translate to market capitalizations of $12.8 trillion and $1.8 trillion, respectively. This would equate to $650,000 and $91,000 for the Bitcoin price in bull and bear market scenarios, respectively. Excluding other self-custody inflows, is of the opinion that Bitcoin could indeed surpass gold capitalization by the time the asset manager capital is deployed. Given that gold experienced a 12-year bull run after its ETF was approved, Bitcoin may follow a similar trajectory. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was up 0.49% in the last 24 hours to $64,524. Bitcoin's dominance in the crypto market has reached a three-year high, reflecting strong demand for U.S. exchange-traded funds that hold the largest digital asset, as well as a challenging era for smaller tokens. According to CoinMarketCap data, Bitcoin accounted for about 55% of the $2.4 trillion cryptocurrency market as of the end of last week, a level not seen since April 2021."

Exploring the Impact of Bitcoin Halving on the Altcoin Market Five crucial dimensions of altcoins will be influenced by the Bitcoin Halving 2024:  market sentiment, market price, technology stack, blockchain forks, and allocation of reserves. Several factors, including Bitcoin's 2024 price appreciation and investor sentiment, point to a potential altcoin boom post-halving. Source: Casey Rodarmor, the creator of Bitcoin ordinal NFTs As altcoins adapt to evolving technology, consistent support from the developer community will be critical. Advancements in the Bitcoin network can serve as a blueprint for altcoin ecosystems to cater to increased public demand for faster transactions, better utility, and potential price appreciation. As Bitcoin prices continue to influence the altcoin ecosystem, consensus-based blockchain forks may provide solutions for addressing disagreements within the community. Diversification of Bitcoin reserves into altcoins is also a strategy being anticipated post-halving. With both changes and opportunities abound, investors need to conduct their own research when considering new altcoin investments, with a particular focus on understanding a project's fundamentals and growth prospects."

4/16/2024,Bitcoin Miners Face Revenue Decline Due to Upcoming Code Update,"According to Bloomberg, Bitcoin miners are bracing for a significant drop in their revenue due to a forthcoming code update for the leading cryptocurrency. This update, known as the 'halving', is scheduled to occur later this week and will drastically cut the rewards miners receive for validating transactions on the blockchain. Bitcoin mining is a process that requires substantial energy, where miners use specialized computers to validate transactions on the blockchain. In return, they earn a reward in the form of Bitcoin tokens. This reward, which constitutes the majority of mining revenue, is halved every four years due to a preprogrammed event known as the halving. The impending halving, the fourth since 2012, will decrease the Bitcoin reward from 900 to 450 tokens in daily production. In the face of this challenge, miners are hoping for increased demand from new spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) to push Bitcoin prices higher and offset the negative impact of the halving. The digital asset has seen a surge since traditional asset management firms launched these ETFs in January. These funds have drawn billions of dollars from a broader range of investors, extending beyond the crypto-native communities. However, predicting Bitcoin prices in the short term remains a challenge. 'I think it is very hard to predict Bitcoin prices on any kind of short-term time frame. But over the course of years, I think you have seen a steady course of adoption,' said an unidentified source."
4/16/2024,Dormant Satoshi-Era Bitcoin Wallet Reactivated Amid Market Fluctuations,"According to U.Today, a dormant Bitcoin wallet, inactive since the Satoshi Nakamoto era, has been reactivated. The wallet, which contains Bitcoin worth millions of dollars, was reactivated following Bitcoin's significant drop and subsequent partial recovery. The blockchain address, which holds 50 valued at $3,314,211 at the time of the announcement, had been untouched for 14 years. The last Bitcoin activity in this wallet was in 2010, the year when Bitcoin's enigmatic creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, decided to step back from Bitcoin and vanished, leaving his creation in the hands of a few dedicated developers. In recent months, several dormant cryptocurrency wallets, inactive for 10-14 years, have been noticed to awaken. These wallets hold early mined or purchased Bitcoin coins, as well as Ethereum acquired during the 2014 ICO. Typically, many holders choose to sell their old holdings after a decade, aiming to profit from the surge in BTC or prices. However, in many instances, users only manage to recover their long-lost private keys by now. Over the past weekend, Bitcoin experienced a significant drop of more than 12%, falling from the recently regained $70,900 to $61,970. This drop is believed to be due to a new development in the Middle East. However, Bitcoin has since recovered by more than 7%, reaching $66,342 – the price at which it is currently trading. MicroStrategy's founder, Michael Saylor, recently shared a graph on the X platform showing his company outperforming Bitcoin. The graph indicates that since August 2020, when the company began regular Bitcoin purchases to add to its balance sheet, MSTR's price has risen by an impressive 1,097%. During the same period, Bitcoin appreciated by 463%, with gold increasing only by 16% and silver decreasing by 1%. MicroStrategy has acquired its Bitcoin in recent years by issuing Convertible Senior Notes and other similar types of securities to raise funds from investors to purchase additional Bitcoin."

4/17/2024,Predicted Net Outflow of 924 BTC Post US Stock Market Opening,"According to BlockBeats, on April 17th, data analyst Yu Jin predicts a net outflow of approximately 924 from ETF custody addresses after the opening of the US stock market. The outflow is expected to come from Grayscale (GBTC) and Ark Invest (ARKB), which are projected to lose around 1,470 BTC. On the other hand, the remaining nine ETFs are expected to see an inflow of approximately 546 BTC. Currently, the eleven BTC spot ETFs collectively hold 840,208 BTC, equivalent to about 52.72 billion USD."
4/17/2024,S&P 500's Dip Below 50-Day Moving Average May Impact Bitcoin,"According to U.Today, the S&P 500 has recently closed below its 50-day moving average for the first time in five months. This event, considered one of the most bullish for the U.S. stock market this year, could potentially impact Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market. The correlation between the stock market and Bitcoin is largely due to investor sentiment. When significant stock indexes like the S&P 500 experience a downturn, it can cause investors across all markets to become apprehensive. This nervousness might lead them to reconsider their investments in perceived riskier assets like Bitcoin. Currently, Bitcoin's price is at a crucial juncture, grappling with the $60,000 mark, a significant psychological level. If Bitcoin manages to maintain above this level and ascend further, the next key level to monitor would be around $67,000, a point where Bitcoin has previously faced resistance. However, if it drops below $60,000, the next support is expected around the $50,000 area, which could potentially cushion a falling price. In the past, Bitcoin has often moved independently, sometimes disregarding the stock market's performance. However, as more traditional stock investors venture into the crypto space, Bitcoin's price movements are beginning to mirror the stock market more closely. This connection suggests that a downturn in the stock market could lead to cautious trading in the cryptocurrency market. If the stock market continues to decline, Bitcoin might also feel the pressure. On the other hand, if the stock market recovers and begins to rise, it could provide Bitcoin with the momentum it needs to challenge its previous highs. The coming days could be critical as investors in both markets monitor these movements. The main takeaway is that the U.S. market's asset movements continue to significantly influence Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market."

4/17/2024,"Top Five Bitcoin Miners Hold, Not Selling in Anticipation of Major Bitcoin Halving Event","According to Cointelegraph: In a deviation from historical trends, the top five Bitcoin mining firms are retaining their Bitcoin (BTC) holdings, unaffected by the looming Bitcoin halving event. Collectively, these firms have slowed selling to a two-year low in Q1 2024, with approximately 2,000 BTC sold, as per the Bitwise report dated April 10. This upcoming Bitcoin halving will involve a 50% issuance reduction, taking Bitcoin block rewards down from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC per block mined. Usually, this event could influence a significant dip in BTC mining revenue, primarily due to the increasing Bitcoin hash rate, affecting profitability for miners. Interestingly, Bitcoin miner revenue soared by 30% quarter-over-quarter, rising above $4.5 billion despite predictions of gloomy outcomes. The CEO of Acheron Trading, Laurent Benayoun, indicated that miner revenues might not necessarily fall in U.S. dollar terms post-halving due to rising network fees. Historically, however, Bitcoin miner revenue has seen considerable declines in the aftermath of halvings; post-2020 and 2016 halvings saw revenues drop by 40% and 51% respectively within a month. Marathon Digital tops the list of the big five, generating over 2,500 BTC in Q1 2024, albeit down from over 4,000 BTC in Q4 2023. The Bitcoin miners worldwide cumulatively hold over 700,000 BTC, representing 3.4% of the total Bitcoin supply."
4/17/2024,Mysterious 'Mr.100' Acquires Large Amounts of Bitcoin Ahead of Halving,"According to BlockBeats, a mysterious entity known as 'Mr.100' has been significantly increasing their Bitcoin holdings as the Bitcoin halving approaches. Over the past three days, 'Mr.100' has purchased nearly all newly mined Bitcoin. On April 15, they bought 800 , followed by 600 BTC on April 16, and 400 BTC on April 17. The total amount of Bitcoin purchased by 'Mr.100' has now surpassed the combined purchases of BlackRock and Fidelity. The Bitcoin halving, a pre-scheduled event that reduces the number of new Bitcoins created and earned by miners, is seen as a significant event in the cryptocurrency market. It is often associated with a surge in the price of Bitcoin, as the reduced supply of new coins can lead to increased demand. The actions of 'Mr.100' suggest that they are anticipating a similar surge following the upcoming halving. The identity of 'Mr.100' remains unknown, but their recent activity has attracted significant attention in the cryptocurrency community. The large volume of Bitcoin they have acquired indicates a strong belief in the future value of the cryptocurrency. The fact that their purchases have outpaced those of major investment firms like BlackRock and Fidelity further underscores the significance of their actions."

4/17/2024,Peter Schiff Challenges Mike Novogratz's Bullish Bitcoin Forecast,"According to U.Today, renowned financial expert and banker Peter Schiff has questioned the recent bullish Bitcoin forecast made by crypto mogul Mike Novogratz. Schiff, who is known for his skepticism towards Bitcoin, has challenged Novogratz's prediction that the influx of buyers through Bitcoin ETFs will significantly increase the digital asset's value. Novogratz had suggested that many Bitcoin ETF buyers, who are new to the crypto space, would act as long-term holders. However, Schiff dismissed this idea, describing them as opportunistic traders instead. He suggested that these 'Johnny-come-lately' buyers lack the conviction of true Bitcoin believers and are merely testing the waters. Schiff also implied that these investors would likely be the first to leave if the market conditions become unfavorable. Schiff's skepticism also extends to the broader implications for Bitcoin-related equities. He highlighted the downturn in various Bitcoin-related stocks, including Coinbase's COIN, GLXY, MSTR, WGMI, MARA, BITF, and . He questioned why these assets are struggling despite the purported bullish sentiment surrounding Bitcoin ETFs. Schiff's critique adds to the ongoing debate over Bitcoin's future trajectory and the potential impact of institutional investment vehicles like ETFs. While Novogratz remains optimistic about Bitcoin's prospects, Schiff's critical viewpoint underscores the divergent opinions within financial circles regarding the crypto's long-term prospects and investment appeal."

4/17/2024,"Bitcoin Halving Expected To Boost BTC Price, Says Former MicroStrategy CEO","According to U.Today, Michael Saylor, the founder and former CEO of MicroStrategy, has highlighted the potential impact of the upcoming Bitcoin halving on the cryptocurrency's price. Saylor, who is now focused on the company's Bitcoin strategy, recently used his Twitter platform to discuss the significance of the halving event. In a tweet accompanied by a short video, Saylor stated, 'Bitcoin moves money forward.' The video illustrated the increasing number of pizzas one could buy with a single Bitcoin from its inception to the present day. The underlying message was that while traditional fiat currency has been depreciating over time, Bitcoin's value has been on the rise. Although the video did not explicitly mention the Bitcoin halving, it did note that 'every four years the future supply of Bitcoin is reduced.' With the Bitcoin halving just three days away, influencers are increasingly emphasizing the importance of this event for the Bitcoin community. Bitcoin halvings, which reduce the future supply of Bitcoin, have historically led to a surge in the cryptocurrency's price. For instance, Bitcoin reached an all-time high (ATH) of $20,000 in 2017 following the 2016 halving. Similarly, after the April 2020 halving, Bitcoin's price soared to a historic peak of $69,000. This year, Bitcoin achieved a new ATH of nearly $73,000 in March, even before the halving, largely due to a significant Bitcoin buying spree initiated by spot Bitcoin ETFs in January. Samson Mow, a prominent figure in the crypto world, also anticipates that Bitcoin will reach its 'Omega time' shortly after the halving."
4/17/2024,"Bitcoin's Recent Price Drop Is Typical Pre-Halving Fluctuation, Says CryptoQuant","According to U.Today, Bitcoin's recent 16.65% price drop has caused concern among traders, especially with the fourth halving of the cryptocurrency just days away. However, data analysis firm CryptoQuant suggests that this is not an anomaly, but a typical pre-halving price fluctuation observed in previous halving cycles. Historically, significant price collapses have occurred before each halving cycle. For example, before the second halving, Bitcoin's price dropped by 40.36%, bottoming out at $465, before surging to an all-time high of $19,600. Similarly, before the third halving, there was a 20.35% decrease, with Bitcoin's price reaching $8,078 before climbing to an astounding peak of $69,000. In the context of the current halving cycle, the recent 16.65% decrease in Bitcoin's price is well within the expected range of pre-halving fluctuations. This pattern, although it may vary in percentages, has consistently repeated itself across each halving cycle. Therefore, CryptoQuant suggests there is no need for undue alarm or panic. Despite the recent price decline, CryptoQuant remains optimistic about the future prospects of Bitcoin and the crypto market as a whole. The path to the current cycle's peak is still open, and according to CryptoQuant, the market is still at the beginning of this journey. This perspective underscores the importance of a long-term investment strategy and the need to remain patient and informed amid market fluctuations. In conclusion, while the recent 16.65% decline in Bitcoin's price may have caused concern and uncertainty on the crypto market, historical data and insights suggest that this is a typical and anticipated pre-halving price fluctuation. Understanding these patterns and maintaining a strategic and informed approach can empower investors to navigate the market with confidence and resilience."
4/17/2024,GBTC and ARKB Experience Significant Net Outflows,"According to BlockBeats, data from Farside Investors revealed on April 17th that the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) and the Blockchain Technology ETF (ARKB) experienced substantial net outflows. Specifically, GBTC saw a net outflow of $79.4 million, while ARKB had a net outflow of $12.9 million. The data for BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) and Fidelity's Bitcoin ETF (FBTC) have not yet been released. However, the net outflow situation for GBTC has slightly eased compared to the previous few days. These outflows represent a significant shift in investor sentiment, potentially indicating a decrease in demand for these particular investment products. The reasons behind these outflows are not clear, but they could be due to a variety of factors, including market volatility, changes in investor risk appetite, or shifts in the broader economic landscape. It is important to note that these figures are subject to change as more data becomes available. Investors and market observers should continue to monitor these developments closely."

4/18/2024,Bitcoin Pioneer Recalls First Halving in 2012 Amidst Current Price Drop,"According to U.Today, Charlie Shrem, a Bitcoin pioneer and co-creator of the Bitcoin Foundation, recently shared his recollections of the first Bitcoin halving in 2012 on a social media platform. Shrem revealed that he and his colleagues were concerned about the success of the first halving, despite outwardly appearing confident. In November 2012, the reward for mining a new block was reduced from 50 to 25 BTC. Shrem, along with Erik Voorhees and Roger Ver, were among the early Bitcoin adopters who were unsure if the halving would work as intended. This week, the global Bitcoin community is anticipating the fourth Bitcoin halving, which will decrease block rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC for miners. Each halving event enhances Bitcoin's deflationary feature, making it more scarce as the remaining amount of the 21 million supply is mined more slowly every four years. This allows for a smaller amount of new BTC to be introduced into the market. The last Bitcoin is expected to be mined in 2140. Meanwhile, Bitcoin's value has been on a downward trend for almost a week, since Friday, April 12. It has lost more than 10% of its value, despite two major attempts to recover. Bitcoin was trading close to $71,000 on that day, but at the time of writing, it is valued at $63,513. The recent drop in Bitcoin's value is believed to be due to negative geopolitical developments in the Middle East and comments from Fed Reserve chairman Jerome Powell about inflation being stronger than previously assessed. As a result, the likelihood of the Fed reducing interest rates has significantly decreased, which is unfavorable for risk assets, including Bitcoin."

4/18/2024,Latest Bitcoin Core Update Released Ahead of Halving: Key Changes and Impact,"According to U.Today, the latest update to Bitcoin Core, v27.0, has been released, bringing significant changes to the functionality of the world's largest blockchain. This update is the last one before the fourth halving, which will reduce Bitcoin ( ) emissions to 3,125 Bitcoins per block. The new version, published in Bitcoin's GitHub repository, deprecates the decade-old Bitcoin library libbitcoinconsensus and introduces new software formats to enhance the interaction between Bitcoin Core and third-party programs. The networking between the blockchain element now defaults to BIP324 v2 transport, with the previous version (v1) only being used in case of v2 failure. The update also brings improvements to the Bitcoin ( ) mempool and discontinues support for external signing on Windows due to security concerns. The release was authored by 63 Bitcoin Core members, including notable figures such as Hennadii Stepanov, Jameson Lopp, Luke Dashjr, Peter Todd, and Pieter Wuille. In addition to these major changes, Bitcoin Core has also received enhancements in synchronization and performance characteristics. However, the release of the update coincides with a significant drop in Bitcoin's price. The cryptocurrency is now targeting $60,000 as a new level for its dropdown, after losing 11% in seven days and touching seven-week lows. This price plunge has resulted in over $70 million in liquidations, with $24 million being erased in the last hour."

4/18/2024,Major US Banks Warn Crypto Investors Ahead of Bitcoin Halving,"According to CryptoPotato, two of the largest banks in the United States, JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs, are advising cryptocurrency investors to exercise caution ahead of the upcoming Bitcoin halving. Analysts predict that this halving may not follow the patterns of previous cycles. In a recent report, JPMorgan suggested that Bitcoin's price is unlikely to increase after the halving, and may instead continue the downward trend that began earlier this month. JPMorgan's perspective aligns with its consistently bearish forecasts throughout the year, remaining unswayed by the growing optimism surrounding Bitcoin spot ETFs or the halving. Analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou stated, 'We do not expect bitcoin price increases post-halving as it has already been priced in. In fact, we see a downside for the bitcoin price post-halving for several reasons.' The analysts used the price of gold as a reference point, arguing that Bitcoin's price should only be $45,000 on a volatility-adjusted basis, indicating that its current market price of $63,700 is significantly overbought. This view is supported by a continuing long bias in Bitcoin futures open interest and a lack of venture funding in the crypto industry this year. Goldman Sachs, in a note to clients last week, acknowledged that Bitcoin's past three halving cycles have resulted in substantial price increases in the aftermath, although the exact time it took to reach a new all-time high afterward has varied greatly. This cycle appears even more different: Bitcoin already topped its previous cycle’s all-time high above $69,000 in March, one month before the halving even occurred. The analysts warned against extrapolating past cycles and the impact of halving, given the respective prevailing macro conditions. The halving itself is due later this week, expected on April 20 at 01:44 UTC. Regardless of whether it results in a 'buy the rumor, sell the news' event in the short term, Goldman believes ’s immediate price action is hardly relevant. 'Bitcoin price performance will likely continue to be driven by the said supply-demand dynamic and continued demand for bitcoin ETFs, which combined with the self-reflexive nature of crypto markets is the primary determinant for spot price action,' the bank said."
4/18/2024,"Bitcoin ETFs Show Decrease in Institutional Holders, But No Long-Term Concerns","According to U.Today, recent data indicates a decrease in the number of institutional holders for Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). However, this data is not final and a more comprehensive picture is expected to emerge over the next 30 days. These fluctuations in ETF holder numbers do not necessarily indicate long-term issues for Bitcoin, as financial markets are known for their rapid changes and swift shifts in investor sentiment. Bitcoin is currently facing resistance at approximately $67,000, having recently experienced some retracement. The support level to watch is around $58,000, with a further safety net near the $50,000 mark. If Bitcoin maintains its support levels and sees a resurgence in buying pressure, the narrative around ETFs could quickly shift back to a positive tone. The current decrease in Bitcoin ETF holder numbers could be reflective of broader market hesitations, rather than an outright exodus. It is crucial to distinguish between short-term market jitters and long-term trends. Bitcoin, known for its resilience, has often demonstrated the ability to recover from periods of uncertainty. The ecosystem is known for its volatility, and investors understand that such fluctuations are part of the market. Monitoring the developing trends over the next month will be key to understanding the true direction of Bitcoin ETFs and their holders."
4/19/2024,"Bitcoin Outperforms Gold As Protector Of Purchasing Power, Says Investor Anthony Pompliano","According to U.Today, Angel investor and Bitcoin enthusiast, Anthony Pompliano, recently discussed Bitcoin's performance on CNBC. He highlighted how Bitcoin has outperformed all other savings assets, including gold, and has once again proven its worth as a reliable investment. Pompliano also discussed the impact of Bitcoin's rise on the market value of gold over the past five years. During his interview on CNBC’s Squawk Box show, Pompliano stated that despite the significant pullback seen over the weekend, Bitcoin has been performing exceptionally well. He noted that a few years ago, investors dreamed of Bitcoin reaching $64,000, and now it has increased by approximately 40% year-to-date. Since the last halving four years ago, Bitcoin has risen by 800%, from $8,000 to $64,000, a performance Pompliano described as strong and remarkable. Pompliano also criticized gold, traditionally considered a store of value. He pointed out that over the past five years, gold has only increased by about 11% and is up just 7% year-to-date in 2024. He argued that those who held gold over the past five years have lost purchasing power as inflation has outpaced gold's performance. Pompliano claimed that the narrative of gold as a protector of purchasing power has been debunked, while Bitcoin has proven its worth in this regard over the past five years. Pompliano also discussed the reasons behind Bitcoin's rise this year. He cited the buying spree of spot Bitcoin ETFs, investors buying Bitcoin in anticipation of the halving and subsequent price surge, and the debasement of the U.S. dollar due to the U.S. government's national debt problem. He attributed the recent weekend crash of Bitcoin to fear selling due to tensions in the Middle East."
4/19/2024,"Bitcoin Becomes Crucial For Individuals In High Inflation Countries, Says IMF","According to PANews, a recent working paper from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has highlighted the importance of Bitcoin for individuals in high inflation countries such as Argentina and Venezuela. The paper suggests that Bitcoin is crucial for preserving wealth and accessing global markets during periods of financial instability. The report also indicates that people are turning to Bitcoin to escape the instability of local economies and currencies, and to evade capital controls and strict financial regulation in their home countries. This is particularly the case in emerging markets like Argentina and Venezuela, where Bitcoin liquidity is high. The countries with the highest inflow of Bitcoin include Seychelles, Venezuela, Moldova, Nigeria, and the Central African Republic. Residents are beginning to turn to Bitcoin for cross-border capital flows, making it more than just a speculative investment. Countries like Seychelles and Moldova, which have attracted cryptocurrency exchanges due to their low tax rates and relaxed regulation, are also seeing people view Bitcoin as a safe asset due to currency devaluation and economic instability."

4/19/2024,Bitcoin Options Contracts Worth $1.33 Billion Set to Expire,"According to CryptoPotato, approximately 21,800 Bitcoin options contracts, with a notional value of around $1.33 billion, are due to expire on Friday, April 19. This figure is slightly lower than the previous week's expiry event. The crypto markets have experienced a significant downturn throughout the week, with Bitcoin potentially losing its psychological price level of $60,000. The expiring batch of Bitcoin contracts has a put/call ratio of 0.63, indicating that there are nearly twice as many call (long) contracts expiring as puts (shorts). Despite the market's downturn, the bulls continue to dominate the derivatives markets, with the most open interest at the $80,000 strike price. There is $881 million worth of long contracts at this level, with over $700 million in open interest at both the $70,000 and $75,000 strike prices. The open interest at the $60,000 level, which is closer to the current spot prices and maximum pain point, is just $453 million. Crypto derivatives tool provider Greeks Live noted that despite the 'extreme panic spreading in the market' this week, with Bitcoin losing $60,000 and Ethereum losing $3,000, major term options implied volatility is falling significantly. Implied volatility refers to future measures of market volatility derived from expiring derivatives contracts. Greeks Live added that 'the long side of Ethereum is more fragile and has limited ability to lead the market.' In addition to the Bitcoin options expiry, 297,000 Ethereum options contracts, with a notional value of $960 million, are also set to expire. These contracts have a put/call ratio of 0.42, indicating that longs significantly outnumber shorts. The total market capitalization has remained flat at $2.37 trillion, but markets have begun to trend downwards again during the Friday morning Asian trading session. Bitcoin, which is still correcting, dipped sharply to $60,000, where it found support and bounced back to $62,000 within an hour. Ethereum, on the other hand, dropped to $2,876 before recovering, but it had not reclaimed the psychological $3,000 level at the time of writing and was trading at $2,989. The altcoins were predominantly in the red, with the exception of Toncoin (TON), which had gained 9% on the day."

4/19/2024,Rising US Government Debt Fuels Surge in Bitcoin and Gold Prices,"According to BlockBeats, concerns over the rapid increase in US government debt have been identified as a partial reason for the recent surge in the prices of Bitcoin and gold. Despite this, the US Treasury market remains relatively optimistic about the country's fiscal prospects. The US budget deficit for the fiscal year 2023 has expanded to $1.7 trillion and is expected to reach $2.6 trillion by 2034. Concurrently, US public debt is projected to reach 106% of GDP by 2028, higher than the 97% in the fiscal year 2023. Since 2007, the scale of US debt has soared from $5 trillion to $27 trillion. The growing US government debt has garnered more attention, with interest payments occupying a larger proportion, sometimes even exceeding defense spending. This deteriorating trend has driven demand for Bitcoin and gold, which are often used as tools to hedge against inflation and the decline in the purchasing power of the dollar. Brad Bechtel, Global Head of Foreign Exchange at Jefferies, stated that concerns about the US debt cycle and the devaluation of legal currency have driven the narrative for Bitcoin and gold, leading investors to allocate more to these assets. Lawrence H. White, an economics professor at George Mason University, believes that interest in Bitcoin and gold also stems from intensified inflation turbulence. More worryingly, debt and deficits are still rising in times of peace and full employment, which could trigger a larger increase in debt during the next recession. In addition to hedging risks, the rise in Bitcoin prices is also influenced by the launch of new ETFs and the upcoming halving event. Gold, on the other hand, has reached a historic high due to expectations of interest rate cuts by central banks and the demand for diversification of foreign reserves. Despite this, the rapid deterioration of the US fiscal situation remains a major concern for some investors. Market strategist Michael Hartnett pointed out that the recent highs in gold and tech stocks indicate that the US may have to adopt policies such as yield curve control to prevent a debt crisis. However, Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, stated that several indicators in the current Treasury market show that bonds have not yet reflected the expected deterioration in fiscal prospects. Investors still regard the dollar as a reserve currency and US s as relatively safe assets. If seeking large-scale risk-free assets, the US bond market remains the first choice."

4/20/2024,Impending Expiration Of Bitcoin And Ethereum Options Worth $2.33 Billion,"According to U.Today, Greeks.live, a leading crypto analytics platform, recently shared data about the upcoming expiration of Bitcoin ( ) and Ethereum ( ) options. The data shows that options worth $2.33 billion for both BTC and ETH are due to expire soon, attracting significant interest from traders and investors. Greeks.live reports that 21,564 BTC options are nearing expiration, with a Put Call Ratio of 0.64, suggesting a higher number of put options compared to call options. This indicates a bearish sentiment among investors, with a Maxpain point set at $65,000. The notional value of these expiring BTC options is a substantial $1.4 billion. On the Ethereum side, 298,415 ETH options are set to expire. The data shows a Put Call Ratio of 0.42, with put options also outnumbering call options, indicating a bearish outlook. The Maxpain point for these expiring ETH options is reported to be $3,125, and the total notional value is estimated at $930 million. The crypto market experienced a significant pullback earlier this week, with both Bitcoin and Ethereum seeing declines. Bitcoin's price dropped towards the $60,000 mark, while Ethereum fell towards $3,000. This downturn resulted in shorts recording their most substantial and sustained gains of the year. One of the factors contributing to this downturn is the sharp decrease in Implied Volatilities (IVs) across major terms, primarily due to a significant drop in call option prices. The market's anticipation for Saturday's Bitcoin halving had previously buoyed prices. However, this expectation no longer seems sufficient to support the market. The current market sentiment appears to be more subdued, especially with the recent slowdown in spot ETF inflows. Despite a minor crypto rally today, the actions of major market whales continue to indicate a lack of confidence. Bulls are now seeking additional inflows to strengthen market support post-halving."
4/20/2024,"Bitcoin Halving Event Reduces Mining Rewards, Impacts Miners More Than Market Prices","According to Bloomberg, the much-anticipated Bitcoin halving event took place recently, reducing the mining reward by half. This event, which occurs every four years, is designed to limit the number of Bitcoins in circulation to a maximum of 21 million, as per the original cryptocurrency's code. The halving mechanism was introduced by Bitcoin's anonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, to prevent inflation. The halving event, which was the fourth since 2012, reduced the daily reward for miners from 900 to 450 Bitcoins. Despite the reduction, Bitcoin advocates remain optimistic about the cryptocurrency's future. However, market watchers have noted that the halving was already factored into the price, resulting in limited price movement. The impact of Bitcoin mining on the total number of tokens in circulation decreases with each halving. For instance, the number of tokens mined after the first halving represented 50% of the total Bitcoins at the time, while the new supply in the upcoming cycle will only account for 3.3%. The halving event is expected to have a more significant impact on Bitcoin mining companies than on the cryptocurrency's price. Bitcoin mining, which is an energy-intensive process, involves using specialized computers to validate transactions on the blockchain. Large-scale miners are expected to consolidate, with publicly-traded firms gaining market share due to their greater access to funding and ability to invest in more efficient equipment. The next Bitcoin halving is scheduled for 2028, reducing the reward for miners to 1.5625 from 3.125 for successfully processing a block of transaction data. Once the 21 million cap is reached, miners will have to rely on transaction fees, which currently constitute a small portion of their total revenue."

4/20/2024,Bitcoin's Next Bull Market Peak: A Look at Potential Timelines,"According to U.Today, a recent analysis by crypto analyst Rekt Capital has highlighted the possible timeline for Bitcoin's ( ) next bull market peak. The analysis emphasizes the significant influence of the halving cycle on BTC’s market trajectory. Historically, Bitcoin tends to reach its bull market peak between 518 and 546 days following a halving event. Based on this pattern, the next bull market peak is projected to occur between mid-September and mid-October 2025. However, current market trends suggest that Bitcoin's present cycle may be moving faster than previous ones. The Bitcoin price reached a new all-time high approximately 260 days ahead of the typical schedule. Despite this acceleration, Bitcoin has experienced a pre-halving retrace over the past month. This retrace has resulted in a slowdown in the cycle, pushing the timeline to about 230 days ahead of schedule, rather than the previously observed 260 days. This slowdown has extended the bull market cycle by approximately 30 days so far. Rekt Capital also proposed an 'Accelerated Perspective' that takes into account the time from when Bitcoin surpasses its previous all-time high to the potential bull market peak. Under this perspective, the peak could be expected between 266 and 315 days after surpassing the previous all-time high. Considering that hit new all-time highs in March, this perspective suggests that the next bull market peak might occur between December 2024 and February 2025. Both the traditional halving cycle timeline and the Accelerated Perspective provide valuable insights into Bitcoin's potential bull market peak. The current acceleration in the cycle suggests that the typical halving cycle length could be halved, potentially leading to an earlier market peak. However, the impact of retracements and consolidations on the overall cycle must be considered. Extended periods of retracement or consolidation could further slow down the cycle, delaying the expected bull market peak. As Bitcoin continues its current market cycle, these key factors are being closely monitored to gain a clearer understanding of when the next bull market peak might occur."

Increased interest, triggered by predictions of a post-halving market value rise, facilitated the inflow into five of the 10 approved ETFs, overruling the outflows primarily from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC). Spot Bitcoin ETF net flows. Source: Farside These inflows, coupled with $54.8 million from the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) just before the Bitcoin halving event, totaled to a positive net of $30.4 million in the U.S. Bitcoin ETF market. This figure effectively counters the cumulative outflows from GBTC and Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund, valued at $47.6 million. The rise in Bitcoin investment in ETFs mirrored the cryptocurrency's considerable value appreciation from about $8,500 during May 2020's halving event, to around $65,000 within four years.

Major Bitcoin miners, in preparation for the event, have been significantly investing in new equipment. Marathon Digital, for instance, has planned to procure a 200-megawatt (MW) Bitcoin mining facility in Texas for $87.3 million. Similarly, the Riot Platforms expanded its hash power with the purchase of 66,560 mining rigs from MicroBT in December 2023.

4/20/2024,Legendary Trader Peter Brandt Hints At Major Bitcoin Price Move,"According to U.Today, renowned trader Peter Brandt has hinted at a significant price move for Bitcoin in a recent social media post. Brandt identified a recurring pattern in Bitcoin's market behavior, which he breaks down into three phases: Hump-Slump, Bump-Rump, and Pump-Dump. This characterization captures the cyclical nature of Bitcoin price movements. The current cycle has completed the two phases of hump-slump and bump-rump, with the third phase, pump-dump, still ongoing. The 'dump' part of this phase has been fulfilled, leaving the 'pump' part yet to occur. Brandt's hint comes at a time of increased volatility and uncertainty in the cryptocurrency market, with Bitcoin experiencing price drops. The potential for a major price move, as suggested by Brandt, adds intrigue to Bitcoin's price trajectory. Adding to this intrigue is the upcoming Bitcoin halving event, a phenomenon that historically impacts the price of Bitcoin. Halving reduces the reward for mining new blocks, effectively decreasing the rate at which new Bitcoins are created. This event has previously led to increased demand and a subsequent price rise, aligning with Brandt's suggestion of a major move ahead. Analysts from JPMorgan Chase and Deutsche Bank believe that the halving, which has long been touted as a major bullish factor for the Bitcoin price, has already been priced in. They stated in a note that the biggest impact will be on Bitcoin mining rather than its price. The exact timing and magnitude of the anticipated move remain unclear, but traders and investors are closely monitoring the market for further indicators that could suggest Bitcoin's next move. Bitcoin recovered after falling sharply to intraday lows of $59,573. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was up 5.13% in the last 24 hours to $64,641 as selling by traders seemed to ease."
4/20/2024,Venture Capitalist Tim Draper Forecasts Bitcoin Price Could Reach $10 Million,"According to U.Today, in a recent interview, renowned venture capitalist Tim Draper has made a bold prediction about the future of Bitcoin. He believes that the cryptocurrency's price could potentially skyrocket to $10 million. Draper suggests that this could happen when Bitcoin becomes a universally accepted form of payment for everyday necessities such as food, clothing, and shelter, as well as taxes. He believes that once this happens, people will not want to use any other currency. Draper, who has a reputation for his early investments in companies like Skype, also anticipates a devaluation of the U.S. dollar against Bitcoin. He also spoke about the upcoming halving event, predicting that it will trigger another surge in the price of the world's largest cryptocurrency. It's important to note that this halving cycle is unique because Bitcoin's price reached a new all-time high before the block reward reduction, largely due to the success of spot ETFs. Draper referred to these ETFs as an 'accelerant' that he hadn't anticipated. Draper, an early Bitcoin investor, had previously accurately predicted that Bitcoin would surpass $10,000 in 2017. He has also repeatedly forecasted that Bitcoin would hit $250,000 in 2022, a prediction that turned out to be incorrect. Draper admitted that his overconfidence may have led to this inaccurate prediction, and he also blamed heavy-handed regulators for slowing down the progress of Bitcoin. He had expected Bitcoin payments to become widespread in 2022, but this did not happen. 'Those are the two things that slowed down the progress,' he concluded."
4/21/2024,Rise in Bitcoin Mining Revenue: Impact of Bitcoin's Halving and Record High Transaction Fee,"According to CoinDesk: Contrary to expectations, Bitcoin’s “halving” event didn’t slash revenues for Bitcoin ( ) mining companies. Thanks to the simultaneous launch of Casey Rodarmor's Runes protocol, transaction fees surged, resulting in higher profits for Bitcoin miners. The debut of Runes protocol drove up Bitcoin transaction fees to record levels. (BitInfoCharts) Bitcoin’s notable “halving” procedure, which took place recently, was anticipated to severely reduce Bitcoin miners’ earnings, with rewards for creating new data blocks halved. Nevertheless, the rollout of the new Runes protocol, which caters to minting digital tokens on the pioneering and most vast blockchain, has been so well-received that it led to significant network congestion. This spike in activity paved the way for transaction fees to reach record levels, offering Bitcoin ( ) miners extremely high returns. Bitcoin transaction fees peaked at an average of $127.97 on April 20. That's more than seven times higher than the previous day and approximately double the previous record from three years ago. As a result, the total revenue for Bitcoin miners, factoring both block rewards and transaction fees, soared to a record single-day total of $107.8 million. This development looks promising for major Bitcoin mining companies, such as Marathon Digital Holdings ($MARA), Riot Blockchain ($RIOT), Hut 8 Mining (HUT), and Core Scientific (CORZ). As Bitcoin’s creator Satoshi Nakamoto originally designed, the periodic halvings are an effort to protect Bitcoin from inflation. As the rewards for miners decrease, the question arises – will there be sufficient incentives for miners to continue operating on the blockchain, considering their crucial role to the blockchain network's security. Bitcoin mining revenue shot to a record $107.8 million on April 20 after the launch of the Runes protocol. (YCharts) According to Ten31, a Bitcoin-focused investment firm, concerns about Bitcoin’s long-term 'security budget' are misplaced. Despite a record $107.8 million Bitcoin mining revenue after the launch of Runes, the bolts and nuts of Bitcoin price changes can still be complex for newcomers to understand.

This information is based on data from mempool.space, as of April 21. The decline in transaction fees indicates a less congested network, allowing for faster and cheaper transactions. This could potentially lead to an increase in Bitcoin transactions, as lower fees make it more affordable for users.

4/21/2024,Anthony Scaramucci Forecasts Potential Bitcoin Valuation Increase,"According to U.Today, renowned investor Anthony Scaramucci has recently shared his perspective on the future price of Bitcoin in relation to the halving event that took place last Friday. During his latest appearance on Wealthion, Scaramucci, a long-standing advocate for cryptocurrency, emphasized the substantial demand for Bitcoin. This demand is largely driven by investors purchasing into ETFs such as BlackRock and Kathy Wood's funds, while the network only generates 450 coins daily. Scaramucci noted that this demand often leads to a surge in prices. However, following the halving event, prices usually drop. He explained that this is due to many short-term Bitcoin holders selling after making profits, while new investors enter the market. Scaramucci stressed his personal strategy of holding Bitcoin for the long term, regardless of price fluctuations. He cited Bitcoin's robust performance over the past 14 years as proof of its value. Scaramucci advised against viewing Bitcoin as a lottery ticket due to its volatility. Instead, he encouraged people to invest in it to become part of the revolution. He suggested starting with a small investment to understand Bitcoin's technical properties and experience the thrill of being involved in the cryptocurrency space. Previously, Scaramucci expressed his views on the future price of Bitcoin. He anticipates a potential valuation increase of up to 10 times from the current level, which could reach $6-8 million. Despite this optimistic forecast, Scaramucci stated that Bitcoin is currently neither a strong inflation hedge nor a fully established store of value. He attributed this to the relatively low global adoption of the coin, suggesting that significant changes would not occur until Bitcoin attracts at least a billion users, a milestone he expects around 2026."

4/21/2024,"Bitcoin's Fourth Quantitative Hardening Arrives, CEO Samson Mow Announces","According to U.Today, Samson Mow, the former Chief Security Officer at Blockstream and current CEO at Bitcoin-adoption company Jan3, has announced the arrival of the much-anticipated fourth Bitcoin halving, which he refers to as the '4th Bitcoin quantitative hardening.' This term is used in contrast to the quantitative easing frequently implemented by the U.S. Federal Reserve, which involves injecting billions of dollars into the economy, a move that many experts believe is causing the U.S. dollar to devalue. Experts suggest that these quantitative easing measures were a significant factor in driving the Bitcoin price above $61,500 in April 2021 and then to an all-time high of $69,000 in November of the same year. In 2024, Bitcoin reached a new historic price peak of $73,750 in March, before the halving, a first for the cryptocurrency. Halving events reduce the number of new Bitcoins entering circulation as miners' block rewards. Following this halving, the rewards were cut from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC, where they will remain for the next four years until the fifth halving. Mow commented on this aspect of the halving, stating that any Bitcoin owned before this moment is now twice as hard for miners to procure for the market. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $63,913. Mow also noted that Bitcoin continues to outperform gold, its physical rival traditionally considered a store of value. After the halving, Bitcoin's inflation rate will drop to 0.9%, while gold's will remain at 1.4%. As Anthony Pompliano stated in a recent CNBC interview, those who have held gold over the past five years have lost purchasing power, unlike Bitcoin holders."

4/21/2024,Bitcoin Halving Event Sparks Debate Over Future Trajectory,"According to U.Today, the Bitcoin community recently celebrated the completion of another halving event. This software update, which took effect at 8:10 p.m. Friday, New York time, reduces the reward for mining new blocks by half. Many view this event as a bullish signal for the cryptocurrency's value. However, Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff offers a contrasting perspective. Schiff, a long-time skeptic of Bitcoin and advocate for gold, warns that the halving may not necessarily lead to the anticipated price increase. He suggests that Bitcoin holders may experience a 'halving' of their net worth, implying a potential price drop. Schiff expressed his views via a tweet, 'Congratulations, Bitcoiners, on the Halving. Are you guys commemorating this occasion by throwing parties tonight? I haven't been invited to any. I think halving is an appropriate name for what's happening as soon Bitcoin hodlers experience a halving of their net worths.' As Bitcoin enters a new phase following the completion of its latest halving event, the debate over its future trajectory continues. Before the halving event, on-chain analytics firm IntoTheBlock highlighted the trend of price performance following each Bitcoin halving. They noted that a bullish trend often emerges and lasts about a year. Additionally, miners' BTC holdings reached a 12-year low, suggesting that miners had been net sellers before the halving. Meanwhile, Bitcoin whales, who own more than 0.1% of the total supply, added 19,760 Bitcoins to their holdings at an average price of $62,500 on April 18. Historically, accumulations by these addresses have frequently foreshadowed increases in Bitcoin's price. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading down 2.17% in the last 24 hours to $63,738 as investors took profits following the halving event."

4/22/2024,Bitcoin Generates Record $78.3 Million in Fees Following Launch of Runes,"According to U.Today, Bitcoin generated a record $78.3 million in fees on April 20, significantly outpacing Ethereum's $3.2 million. This surge in fees followed the launch of Bitcoin Runes by the creators of Ordinals after the halving event. The protocol allows for the creation of fungible tokens on the leading blockchain. Lucas Outumuro, a researcher at IntoTheBlock, described the launch of Runes as 'absolutely insane.' He noted that the $80 million in daily fees is about four times larger than the previous all-time high set in December 2017. During the ordinals, the average transaction fee was $30, but it has now peaked at $128. Despite the recent halving event, which saw block rewards drop by 50%, miners are now earning record revenues. On Saturday, they earned more than $100 million. This is a significant shift from the previous consensus that miners would face short-term strain following the halving, with prominent miners' stocks dropping more than 50% from their record highs. Outumuro suggested that traditional finance was not aware of the launch of Runes. 'It's been less than 48 hours since the launch of Runes and it has already made an impact of historic proportions,' he said. However, it remains to be seen whether the hype surrounding Runes will continue. So far, retail appears to be sitting on the sidelines, as the number of retail addresses has reached a new low. Despite some pushback within its conservative community, Runes could potentially emerge as a solution to Bitcoin's long-standing security problem."

4/22/2024,Bitcoin Layer-2 Solution Stacks Launches Nakamoto Upgrade,"According to Blockworks, Bitcoin layer-2 solution Stacks has begun the rollout of its Nakamoto upgrade. This development, which follows the recent halving, is aimed at improving transaction throughput and ensuring Bitcoin finality for layer-2 transactions. The upgrade is expected to speed up block processing and finalize all settlements on the layer-1, allowing Bitcoin to maintain its security while becoming programmable, akin to Ethereum and Solana Virtual Machines. Muneeb Ali, co-founder of Stacks, believes that the Nakamoto upgrade and the overall expansion of Bitcoin layer-2 infrastructure could reignite interest in the Bitcoin blockchain. Ali stated that users are now distinguishing between as an asset and Bitcoin as a platform. He noted that BTC has established itself as a hedge or store of value, resulting in nearly $1 trillion in idle capital. Ali credits advancements like the Nakamoto upgrade for this resurgence. The Stacks team anticipates that the Nakamoto upgrade rollout will continue over the next month, reducing block times from the current 10-30 minutes to approximately five seconds. Ali suggests that these enhancements will allow Bitcoin layer-2s to support the growing number of DeFi applications being developed. He also believes that the market is realizing that Bitcoin can serve as the base layer for the industry, with layer-2s facilitating an economic flywheel around BTC through apps and smart contracts. In addition to the improved Bitcoin layer-2 infrastructure, Ali highlights that other types of innovations are also attracting significant interest in the Bitcoin blockchain. These include ordinals and BRC-20s, which experienced a surge in interest following Bitcoin’s all-time high last month. Ali encourages further research and development around layer-2s, Ordinals, Runes, and other innovations, predicting a layer-2 summer where the Bitcoin developer ecosystem and competition intensify post-halving."
4/22/2024,Digital Asset Investment Products Witness Second Consecutive Week Of Outflows,"According to PANews, the latest weekly report from CoinShares reveals that digital asset investment products experienced a net outflow of $206 million last week.

4/22/2024,Bitcoin Miner Hut 8's Diversified Revenue Streams Could Provide Long-Term Advantage,"According to Blockworks, Bitcoin miner Hut 8's diversified revenue streams could potentially give it a long-term advantage over its competitors, as per analysts at Benchmark. The research firm began covering the stock three days after the Bitcoin halving, when per-block rewards decreased from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC. Senior equity research analyst at Benchmark, Mark Palmer, assigned Hut 8 a buy rating and a price target of $12, approximately 50% higher than its current trading level. Hut 8's 2025 enterprise value-to-revenue multiple is 2.6, compared to the average 3.1 multiple of its competitors, based on Benchmark data. This research considered the multiples of Marathon Digital, Riot Blockchain, CleanSpark, Bitfarms, Cipher Mining, Iris Energy, Hive Digital Technologies, and TeraWulf. The figures are based on consensus 2025 revenue estimates, and the enterprise values include the companies’ net debt balances. Palmer stated that Hut 8 is expected to close the valuation gap with listed peers that are further along in boosting their self-mining capacity as it executes on the build-out of its platform. Investors are currently focused on self-mining due to expectations that the price of bitcoin will rally aggressively following the latest halving. Hut 8’s self-mining deployed hash rate is 5.4 exahash per second (EH/s), lagging behind some of the space’s largest players. However, Palmer believes that the diversity of Hut 8’s platform will benefit it over the long-term, as its revenue streams outside of self-mining position it to weather severe downturns in bitcoin’s price better than most of its listed peers. This comes after Hut 8 and US Bitcoin Corp. underwent a “merger of equals” that closed in November. The combined company has business lines focused on managed services, hosting, high-performance computing, and AI. Hut 8 CEO Asher Genoot has stated that he is examining every business line to identify and eliminate inefficiencies and reduce costs. The company recently energized a third of its 63 MW Salt Creek site in Culberson County, TX, relocating miners from its Kearney, NE and Granbury, TX sites. Genoot believes that this move will provide control over their miner fleet and operating costs. Despite the need for more efficiency upgrades in Hut 8’s mining fleet, Palmer noted that its holdings of 9,102 give it a solid liquidity cushion and the ability to capture upside during bitcoin price rallies. He concluded that the company’s diversified model and relative strength in bitcoin’s price should support its operating performance until new equipment is purchased and deployed."
4/22/2024,Grayscale Aims To Retain Spot Bitcoin ETF Market Leadership With New Mini Trust,"According to CryptoPotato, Grayscale, the world's largest asset manager, is striving to maintain its dominance in the spot Bitcoin ETF market. This comes after a significant capital withdrawal from its primary GBTC product. To compete with its ten competitors, Grayscale has proposed a smaller Bitcoin ETF with highly competitive fees. Grayscale's new ETF, the Bitcoin Mini Trust, has set fees at a mere 0.15%, according to its recent filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. On April 21, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas responded to the news, stating that Grayscale's mini- would have a fee of 15bps, potentially making it the most affordable BTC ETF on the market. However, he clarified that this is still hypothetical and does not guarantee a fund fee of 15bps. The existing Grayscale Bitcoin Trust charges a 1.5% fee, which is one of the reasons it has lost a significant portion of its assets under management compared to lower-fee competitor funds. The Franklin Bitcoin ETF (EZBC) is currently the closest competitor to the new fund, with fees at 0.19%. When the Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC) is launched, the company will transfer 10% of the GBTC assets to the new fund, according to the filing. This could amount to approximately 30,500 BTC, worth around $2 billion. However, if GBTC continues to experience steady outflows until the mini-BTC fund is launched, this figure is likely to be lower. Shares of the new fund will be automatically issued and distributed to GBTC shareholders. Since converting to a spot ETF in mid-January, GBTC has lost over 50% of its holdings. The fund currently holds 304,970 BTC following a $45.8 million outflow on Friday. Last week, Grayscale lost $458 million, although the outflows began to slow towards the end of the week. On April 19, Nate Geraci, President of ETF Store, stated that the consensus among industry analysts was that spot ETFs would likely be disapproved by the SEC in late May due to lack of engagement."

4/22/2024,Historic Bitcoin Sign Set for Auction,"According to Bloomberg, a historic sign that became a symbol for Bitcoin supporters is set to be auctioned. The sign, which was displayed behind then-Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen during a Congressional testimony in 2017, was created by Christian Langalis, a 22-year-old Bitcoin owner and intern at the Libertarian think tank Cato Institute. After the sign was caught on television, Langalis was escorted out of the hearing but received about seven Bitcoin in unsolicited donations. At the time, Bitcoin was gaining public attention, trading at around $2,300, up from less than $1,000 six months earlier. The cryptocurrency surged more than 13,000% in 2017, only to crash 74% the following year. This boom-and-bust cycle has become a common pattern for the digital asset. With Wall Street giants like BlackRock and Fidelity now supporting the token, Langalis is looking to capitalize on the current momentum that saw Bitcoin reach a record high of almost $74,000 in March. In 2019, Langalis sold 21 replica editions of the sign for an average realized price of 0.8 Bitcoin. These replicas, numbered and time-stamped, were created by Langalis himself. Recently, Langalis was offered five Bitcoin for the original sign, currently worth around $330,000, but decided to auction it instead. The materials describe the item as an 'Ink Drawing on Legal Pad' weighing half a pound, which also contains Langalis's notes from the hearing. The page with the sign drawing was removed from the notepad shortly after the hearing and has since been reattached with clear archival wire. The winner of the auction will be announced at a Bitcoin-themed eatery called the Pubkey in New York, where Langalis uses as a co-working space. The sign was previously displayed at the ."

Dragosch believes that any positive impacts related to the halving have not yet been reflected in the market. Such effects are likely to start appearing approximately 100 days after the halving event. This delay is due to the supply shortage caused by Bitcoin halving, which only accumulates over time."

The CVDD price, which represents when old hands sell, also known as the 'bottom' model."
4/22/2024,Bitcoin Layer 2 Solution Tokens Outperform BTC Post-Halving,"According to CryptoPotato, Bitcoin layer 2 solution tokens have shown superior performance compared to Bitcoin ( ) following the recent halving of the mining reward on the blockchain. These tokens have seen a surge of 5% to 20% since the event, outpacing the top cryptocurrency by market capitalization. The market cap for Bitcoin layer 2 solutions stands at $4.3 billion, marking a 5.6% increase in the past 24 hours, with a trading volume of $184 million. Stacks ( ), a Bitcoin layer 2 solution, has been among the top-performing cryptocurrencies in the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko data. The STX token has surged almost 20% to $2.87 since the halving event. In contrast, Bitcoin has not seen significant growth, with the token up slightly over 4.5% to $66,046 since the halving event, 1.7% over the last 24 hours, and down 0.8% over the last 7 days. Bitcoin’s price experienced significant volatility last week, dropping from over $66,800 to below $60,000, but has since recovered. Other layer 2 tokens, such as Elastos’ ELA token and SatoshiVM’s SAVM, have also seen gains of 11% and 5%, respectively, since the halving. Other altcoins have observed slight daily gains, except for TON, which has experienced a significant double-digit decline despite Tether’s announcement of expanding to the TON blockchain. Bitcoin layer 2 solutions address blockchain scalability and transaction speed limitations by operating on the Bitcoin blockchain and processing transactions off the main chain. On April 20, when the halving occurred and the Runes protocol launched, Bitcoin transaction fees reached an average of $128.45, according to ycharts data. This figure is over six times higher than the average fee rate the day prior and approximately double the previous record set three years ago. The fee surge can be attributed to the launch of the Runes protocol, which enables users to “etch” and mint tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain. The introduction of Runes prompted speculators to rush into minting tokens and trading meme coins, leading to increased transaction activity and, subsequently, higher transaction costs. However, the fees have since come down, and the transaction fees dropped to $34.8 on April 21. According to data from Ord.io, the total number of Runes inscriptions on the Bitcoin blockchain has already reached 3,700."
4/22/2024,Early Bitcoin Contributor Reveals Previously Undisclosed Emails With Satoshi Nakamoto,"According to U.Today, Martti Malmi, an early contributor to Bitcoin, has recently made public a series of previously undisclosed emails exchanged with the mysterious Bitcoin creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. These emails provide fresh insights into the early days of Bitcoin and Nakamoto's philosophical approach to the digital currency. A key revelation from these emails is Nakamoto's view of Bitcoin as primarily a medium of exchange, rather than just an investment tool. Nakamoto highlighted the energy efficiency of Bitcoin's proof-of-work mechanism in comparison to traditional banking systems, addressing environmental concerns before they became a significant issue. An email dated May 2, 2009, shows Nakamoto praising Malmi for understanding Bitcoin's potential. He suggested that linking Bitcoin to fiat currencies could enhance its value, a topic he was reluctant to discuss publicly until the right time. Nakamoto also emphasized the need to prepare for a surge in users, predicting widespread adoption. Moreover, Nakamoto foresaw Bitcoin's capacity to scale up to handle transaction volumes much larger than those managed by traditional financial systems, and at a fraction of the cost. He assured that as the network expanded, it would become more secure, dismissing early vulnerabilities as minor startup issues. Interestingly, the emails also reveal Nakamoto's request for assistance with website content, demonstrating his willingness to collaborate and delegate tasks. Discussions also revolved around Bitcoin-like encryption, backups, and user-friendliness, indicating Nakamoto's commitment to making Bitcoin accessible and secure for the masses. These email exchanges add depth to the narrative around Satoshi Nakamoto and the origins of Bitcoin, offering intriguing details that could potentially shed more light on Nakamoto's secret identity. However, one thing remains clear: Satoshi Nakamoto's vision closely aligns with what Bitcoin has become today, despite its continuous evolution."
4/23/2024,"Bitcoin Halving May Lead to Supply Shock and 'Omega Candles', Says Jan3 CEO","According to U.Today, Samson Mow, the CEO of Jan3, recently discussed the potential impact of Bitcoin halving on the cryptocurrency's supply and price. He anticipates a supply shock and the emergence of 'Omega candles', which could potentially push Bitcoin's value to $1 million. Mow explained the concept of Bitcoin halving to Forbes. The total Bitcoin supply of 21 million coins is gradually introduced to the market by miners in the form of block rewards. This system was designed by Bitcoin's anonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, to occur every four years, with each halving reducing the rewards by 50%. Halvings occur after every 210,000 blocks are generated by miners. This mechanism was implemented to prevent an oversupply of Bitcoin in the market. Initially, miners earned 50 for each new block. Without the four previous halvings, all 21 million Bitcoins would have already been mined. The CEO further highlighted that the approval of spot-based Bitcoin ETFs by the SEC in January sparked new demand for Bitcoin. Companies like BlackRock, Fidelity, Ark Invest, and VanEck were among those who received approval. Mow believes that the combination of reduced block rewards due to halving and the increased demand from these ETFs could lead to a Bitcoin supply shock. Mow also predicted the occurrence of 'Omega candles' in the future. These are large trading candles that signify high volatility and significant price changes. He stated that the daily demand for Bitcoin was already 5-10 times the supply before the halving, making the emergence of Omega candles seem inevitable. Bitcoin halvings are generally seen as bullish indicators for the cryptocurrency market. They not only prove the effectiveness of the Bitcoin protocol but also contribute to Bitcoin's scarcity, drawing it closer to gold. Since the recent halving, Bitcoin has seen an 8.5% increase and is currently trading at $66,200."
4/23/2024,Bitcoin Mining Costs Expected to Rise Following Reward Halving,"According to U.Today, the cost of mining Bitcoin is on the rise, with the recent reward halving making it more expensive for miners. CoinShares reports that it now costs approximately $53,000 to mine a single Bitcoin, an average amount spent by large mining companies. The term 'halving' refers to the process where miners receive half the Bitcoin they used to for decoding blocks containing data about the Bitcoin network. As a result, the cost of operating their mining machines, primarily electricity, could effectively feel like it has doubled. Experts predict that the total power required for Bitcoin mining could increase to 700 Exahash by 2025, indicating a significant increase in the power needed to run the Bitcoin network. However, following the halving, less profitable mining machines may be switched off, potentially reducing this number by around 10%. Despite the challenges, there are potential solutions. Some miners are relocating to areas where they can access cheaper, often wasted energy, such as that would otherwise be burned off. Additionally, the use of AI in countries where energy is stable and affordable is becoming more prevalent. This could be a game-changer, potentially fueling the network in the future. Post-halving, the cost of mining a Bitcoin could increase even further. Miners' expenses, such as electricity and equipment, might almost double on paper, while the price for Kw/h remains the same. To cope with this, miners are seeking better deals on their equipment and cheaper power sources. They are using the extra cash from the bull run and low mining costs to pay off debts and prepare for a shift in the mining market."
4/23/2024,Dogecoin Creator Billy Markus Mocks Bitcoin Investors' Expectations Post-Halving,"According to U.Today, Billy Markus, co-creator of the -inspired cryptocurrency Dogecoin, has taken to social media to express his sarcastic views on the recent trajectory of Bitcoin's price following its halving. Contrary to the expectations of many investors and traders, the price of Bitcoin did not experience a significant increase after the halving event. In a tweet, Markus mocked those who anticipated a tenfold increase in the price of Bitcoin within days of the halving, which took place on April 20 at block 840,000. This marked the fourth halving in Bitcoin's history, reducing block rewards from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC and resulting in 450 new Bitcoins generated per day, down from 900 BTC previously. Markus sarcastically commented on the lack of a price surge, suggesting that those who relied on sources such as TikTok videos, Discord and Telegram chatrooms, and Twitter posts for their market information might now consider Bitcoin a scam. Prior to the halving, Markus had expressed skepticism about the potential for Bitcoin's price to increase. He has previously described cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, as more akin to gambling than a sound investment. He has frequently stated that he does not believe anyone can accurately predict the direction of Bitcoin's price, attributing price increases to widespread buying and decreases to widespread selling. In the days leading up to the halving, Bitcoin's price increased by nearly 7%, adding approximately $5,000. Since then, the price has seen a modest increase of 1.85%, following a series of minor fluctuations."
4/23/2024,Mysterious 'Mr.100' Sells 1000 BTC For The First Time Since March,"According to BlockBeats, a mysterious entity known as 'Mr.100' sold 1000 Bitcoin ( ) on April 23. This marks the first time the entity has sold any BTC since March 8. Prior to this, 'Mr.100' had been accumulating a significant amount of Bitcoin in the days leading up to the halving. The identity of 'Mr.100' remains unknown, and the reasons behind this recent sale are unclear. The sale comes amidst a period of volatility in the cryptocurrency market, with Bitcoin's price fluctuating significantly in recent weeks. Despite this, 'Mr.100's' decision to sell a large amount of Bitcoin could potentially have an impact on the market, depending on the timing and manner of the sale. However, without further information, it is difficult to predict the potential effects of this sale on the wider cryptocurrency market."
4/23/2024,Bitcoin Spot ETF Trading Volume Data Revealed,"According to PANews, the trading volume data for Bitcoin spot ETFs on April 23rd has been released by HODL15Capital. The data shows that BlackRock's IBIT had a trading volume of $661 million. Grayscale's GBTC followed with a trading volume of $224 million. Fidelity's FBTC was not far behind with a trading volume of $233 million. ProShares' BITO had a trading volume of $170 million. ARKB and BITB had trading volumes of $61.53 million and $60.51 million respectively. This data provides a snapshot of the trading activity in the Bitcoin spot ETF market. It shows the level of interest and activity in these financial products, which are designed to track the price of Bitcoin. These ETFs provide a way for investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without having to buy and hold the cryptocurrency directly. The trading volumes of these Bitcoin spot ETFs can be seen as a barometer of investor sentiment towards Bitcoin. High trading volumes can indicate strong investor interest and confidence in the future price of Bitcoin. Conversely, low trading volumes can suggest a lack of interest or confidence in the market. The data released by HODL15Capital provides valuable insights into the state of the Bitcoin spot ETF market."
4/23/2024,Cboe BZX Exchange Proposes Changes To Franklin Bitcoin ETF,"According to BlockBeats, on April 23, the Cboe BZX Exchange submitted a proposal to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to amend the previously approved Franklin Bitcoin ETF. Specifically, the proposal aims to change the deadline for cash purchase basket orders from 3 PM Eastern Time to 2 PM, the regular closing time of the exchange, or any other time determined by the initiator. This change is intended to provide more flexibility for the fund initiator in determining the purchase deadline. The proposed amendment by the Cboe BZX Exchange is a significant move in the cryptocurrency market, as it seeks to provide more flexibility for the fund initiator. The Franklin Bitcoin ETF, which was previously approved by the SEC, is one of the many financial instruments that have been introduced in recent years to provide investors with exposure to the volatile cryptocurrency market. The proposed change in the deadline for cash purchase basket orders is expected to have a significant impact on the operation of the ETF. The Cboe BZX Exchange's proposal is currently under review by the SEC. If approved, it could set a precedent for other exchanges and financial instruments in the cryptocurrency market. The SEC's decision on this proposal will be closely watched by investors and market participants, as it could have far-reaching implications for the operation and regulation of Bitcoin ETFs and other similar financial instruments."
4/23/2024,Block Inc. Completes Development of Advanced Bitcoin Mining Chip,"According to CryptoPotato, Block Inc., the fintech company led by Jack Dorsey, has announced the completion of its advanced Bitcoin mining chip. This marks a significant milestone for the company's mining project. The three nanometre (3mn) Bitcoin mining chip is now undergoing its full design tapeout with a leading semiconductor foundry. The chip will utilize the most advanced semiconductor process currently available, aiming to deliver the performance required for mining operators of all types to survive and thrive in the fifth mining epoch and beyond. The fifth mining epoch began last Friday after Bitcoin block 840,000, reducing Bitcoin’s fixed block subsidy from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC per block. This decrease marks a significant cut to miner revenues, necessitating that miners acquire the most energy-efficient equipment to stay effective. Many public mining firms have noted that small-scale, at-home Bitcoin mining would become more competitive after the Bitcoin halving, if not outright impossible to do economically. In response to this trend, Dorsey announced his firm’s Bitcoin mining ambitions in early 2022, aiming to keep both Bitcoin’s hash rate and the distribution of mining hardware as decentralized as possible. Block Inc. is continuing to incorporate feedback from the Bitcoin and mining industry into its chip design. Upon launch, the company will become the first Bitcoin mining hardware vendor with a solution of its kind. The company hopes this will help unlock mining system innovation and support the development of new mining system form factors and use cases. In addition to the mining chip, the company is also working on a full Bitcoin mining system of its own design and is still seeking design feedback on this system in areas related to reliability, maintenance, and software features. In other efforts to aid Bitcoin development, Jack Dorsey and Block have financed legal protection for Bitcoin developers and pioneered Bitcoin-based tips over Twitter. Block also unveiled its Bitcoin hardware wallet 'Bitkey' last year, which provides multi-signature cold storage Bitcoin custody in a way that’s usable for crypto newcomers."

4/23/2024,PayPal Proposes Incentives for Bitcoin Miners to Use Clean Energy,"According to Blockworks, a recent report by PayPal's internal research group suggests that economic incentives could encourage bitcoin miners to adopt cleaner energy sources. Bitcoin's proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism has been criticized for its high computational intensity, which has raised environmental concerns. The report proposes a solution that involves offering additional bitcoin rewards to miners who use low-carbon energy sources. Under the PoW mechanism, bitcoin miners are compensated with bitcoin for their computational work. The report suggests that a small additional amount of bitcoin could be allocated to miners who prioritize environmentally friendly practices. The proposed program would begin by identifying 'green miners' who use clean energy or have a minimal impact on energy grids. These miners would be identified by their public keys, referred to as 'green keys'. To incentivize these green miners, certain bitcoin transactions would include a UTXO with a multisig wallet containing extra bitcoin. This wallet could only be accessed by green keys. These transactions would also feature lower-than-average fees, making them more attractive to green miners. The report likens this approach to providing an 'indirect grant' to bitcoin miners who use cleaner energy. However, the report acknowledges potential drawbacks. For instance, miners who do not prioritize green practices could still pick up transactions earmarked for green miners if the low fees are not a deterrent. The report also suggests measures to prevent 'malicious green miners' from driving up transaction fees on green transactions for personal gain. The report does not specify the amount of the 'subsidy', only stating that the green miner multisig would contain 'some bitcoins'. If the public mempool solution proposed by PayPal is not effective, the report suggests that smart contracts or the Lightning Network could be used to privately reward green miners. This would, however, require a level of trust. The report was produced by PayPal's Blockchain Research Group, which has been operational since around 2015. The group tested aspects of the incentivization program with blockchain company DMG."

4/23/2024,MicroStrategy's Michael Saylor Sparks Debate With Bitcoin-Robot Tweet,"According to U.Today, Michael Saylor, founder and former CEO of MicroStrategy, has ignited a debate within the Bitcoin community with a recent tweet. Saylor, who is currently part of MicroStrategy's managing board and oversees the company's Bitcoin-focused strategy, frequently shares AI-generated images promoting the leading cryptocurrency. His latest tweet, which encouraged followers to 'embrace Bitcoin', featured an image of a young girl standing near a humanoid robot with the word 'Bitcoin' inscribed on it. This choice of image sparked a mixed response from Bitcoin holders, with some finding it peculiar while others expressed approval. This tweet was one of Saylor's first following the Bitcoin halving event, which took place on April 19 in the US and April 20 in the UK and Europe. The halving, also known as ' Day' or '4/20', is a significant event for Bitcoin enthusiasts as it increases the cryptocurrency's scarcity. This year's halving reduced the block reward for Bitcoin miners from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC. The event coincided with the one-year anniversary of the first launch of Elon Musk's SpaceX’s Starship. The halving event is often referred to as Bitcoin's 'quantitative hardening', a term coined by Samson Mow, CEO of Jan3. This is in contrast to the quantitative easing measures frequently implemented by the Federal Reserve, which have led to substantial money printing. The halving is seen as a positive event by Bitcoin supporters, as it increases the scarcity and potential value of the cryptocurrency."
4/23/2024,Bitcoin NFT Project Blob Sees Price Surge Following Announcement of Recursive Runes,"According to BlockBeats, the co-founder of Bitcoin NFT project Blob and the sixth-ranked contributor to the Ordinals protocol, @Elocremarc, has announced the introduction of 'recursive runes'. Following this announcement, the floor price of Blob has risen by 30%, breaking through 0.04 Bitcoin. The term 'recursive' is understood to refer to 'on-chain pointers' that allow inscriptions to reference data on the Bitcoin chain, including data from other inscriptions. This data can include the latest block height, specified block height, and other inscription data, among other things. These are also known as 'recursive endpoints'. @Elocremarc's proposal involves adding a 'recursive endpoint', specifically '/r/output'. Once this recursive endpoint is added, developers will be able to determine the quantity of corresponding runes and whether there are other inscriptions from the transaction output. This will allow inscriptions to change based on the quantity of runes. Based on current understanding, this requires maintaining corresponding inscriptions and runes in a UTXO. If the balance of the runes changes, it will not be possible to determine the change in the balance of the runes from the transaction output, thus causing the inscription image to change accordingly. This suggests that we can look forward to this type of gameplay, such as engraving inscriptions and recording a small image at the same time. Depending on the number of corresponding runes, the resulting small images will be different. More advanced gameplay, such as a full-chain Bitcoin game mentioned by Pizza Ninjas CEO @TO (for example, one NFT equals one game account, runes are game coins, and the game coin balance can be read directly on the NFT), may require further infrastructure support. Finally, it should be noted that the addition of the '/r/output' recursive endpoint is a prerequisite for @Elocremarc's plan. Currently, @Elocremarc has submitted a PR on the official Ordinals Github. If it passes smoothly, we will have 'recursive runes' to play with. In conclusion, 'runes' have been a hot topic in the crypto market over the past week, but despite high attention, they have not shown a good money-making effect. In addition to the 'pre-mining runes' of the project party and the 'fair casting' once played by BRC-20, 'runes' may need more gameplay to stimulate. If 'recursive runes' can be quickly implemented, it will undoubtedly be a strong boost for 'runes'."

4/23/2024,"Bitcoin Proposal BIP-420 Receives Official Support, Advocates for Enhanced Functionality","According to Foresight News, Udi Wertheimer, the co-founder of Taproot Wizards and advocate of OP_CAT, has announced that the OP_CAT proposal has officially received its BIP number, BIP-420. The proposal supports Bitcoin contracts, allowing for smart contracts, secure bridges, on-chain transactions, and zk proof verification. The OP_CAT opcode is expected to simplify and expand Bitcoin's functionality, including making decentralized protocols more practical and supporting advanced multi-signature setups. OP_CAT was initially included as one of the earliest opcodes in Bitcoin. However, due to concerns about creating scripts that could potentially lead to vulnerabilities, the anonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, disabled it along with several other opcodes in 2010. The BIP-420 proposal, written by Ethan Heilman and Armin Sabouri, aims to reintroduce OP_CAT to Bitcoin through a backward-compatible soft fork by 'redefining opcode OP_SUCCESS126'. This uses the same opcode value as the original OP_CAT, aiming to eliminate any potential confusion by not using different opcode values. The proposal focuses solely on reintroducing the opcode, without changing other aspects of script operation limits. The possibility of an OP_CAT soft fork depends on a combination of technical, security, and community consensus considerations. Without widespread consensus and clear evidence of its safety and utility, the implementation of OP_CAT remains uncertain."
4/23/2024,Bitcoin Bull Tom Lee Predicts Market Rally Amid High Short Interest,"According to U.Today, Bitcoin advocate Tom Lee recently expressed his belief that the markets are well-positioned for a rally. In a recent interview on CNBC, Lee highlighted that the median short interest in stocks has reached its highest level in three years. He stated that a positive catalyst is now needed, and as long as inflation performs better than expected, the markets are in a good position to rally. Lee also suggested that the market could be nearing a potential bottom. Despite increasing bearish sentiment, he believes that sharp corrections are a normal part of bull market cycles. He said, 'There's a lot of top callers. To me, there's a good opportunity.' Last week, US Federal Reserve chair Jay Powell admitted that returning inflation to the desired 2 percent target would take longer than anticipated. This statement followed a spike in long-term inflation expectations to the highest level in over a year. According to the BofA credit investor April survey, inflation remains the primary concern for investors. However, nearly half of investors (45%) expect the central bank to achieve a soft landing. On April 17, the price of Bitcoin fell below the $60,000 level, just days before the halving. This drop was partially attributed to the decreasing likelihood of a June rate cut, based on the most recent inflation data. It is now more likely that there will be hikes or zero cuts rather than three rate cuts this year. Despite this, cryptocurrency bull Mike Novogratz remains convinced that the Federal Reserve will still need to cut rates this year."

This recent development indicates a positive trend in the cryptocurrency market, particularly for Bitcoin. The digital currency's value continues to fluctuate, but this recent surge demonstrates its potential for significant growth. The 3.4% increase in a single day is a notable achievement, reflecting the volatile yet promising nature of the cryptocurrency market. However, investors are advised to proceed with caution due to the inherent risks associated with such investments."
4/23/2024,Satoshi Nakamoto's Final Instructions Marked A Pivotal Point In Bitcoin's History,"According to U.Today, thirteen years ago, on April 23, Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious figure behind Bitcoin, gave his final instructions on the Bitcoin ecosystem. This significant event happened just four months after Nakamoto's last public statement in December 2010, marking a crucial turning point in the journey of the world's leading cryptocurrency. In emails disclosed by former Bitcoin Core developer Mike Hearn, Nakamoto indicated a transition, stating, 'I've moved on to other things. It's in good hands with Gavin and everyone.' There is much speculation about Nakamoto's reasons for stepping away from the project. Some suggest a difference in vision, especially considering attempts to associate Bitcoin with initiatives like WikiLeaks donations. Others attribute it to external pressures, such as the alleged CIA inquiry into Gavin Andresen, a prominent figure in the cryptographic community. Regardless of the reasons, the period after Nakamoto's departure saw a significant increase in Bitcoin's prominence. From its modest beginnings, Bitcoin's popularity soared, captivating tech enthusiasts and investors alike. The cryptocurrency's price reached new heights, establishing a new standard in digital finance. Today, Bitcoin stands as a testament to Nakamoto's vision, a decentralized force that is reshaping economies and challenging traditional financial paradigms. Despite numerous attempts to reveal the elusive creator, Nakamoto's identity remains a mystery, adding to the fascination surrounding Bitcoin's origin story. Whether Nakamoto will ever step out of the shadows and reveal himself to the world remains one of the most captivating mysteries in the crypto space."

4/24/2024,Bitcoin Sign From 2017 Congressional Testimony Auctioned For Over $1 Million,"According to Bloomberg, a yellow legal pad with 'Buy Bitcoin' scribbled on it, which was flashed by an intern during a 2017 Congressional testimony, has been auctioned for $1.027 million. The sign, which was displayed during then-Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen's testimony, became a symbol for the burgeoning community of cryptocurrency developers and investors. Since that time, Bitcoin's value has skyrocketed from approximately $2,300 to a record-breaking nearly $74,000 in March. This surge has been fueled by financial giants like Fidelity and BlackRock endorsing the digital asset, and retail investors returning to the crypto market after years of instability and fluctuating prices. The sign was auctioned off by Christian Langalis, a former intern at the Libertarian think tank Cato Institute. Langalis was seated behind Yellen during her appearance before the House Financial Service Committee in July 2017 and quickly wrote the message on the pad. After the sign was seen on television, Langalis was promptly escorted out. The site, Scare City, described the item as an 'Ink Drawing on Legal Pad' that weighs half a pound and includes Langalis's notes from the hearing. The page with the sign was removed from the notepad shortly after the hearing and has since been reattached with clear archival wire. The winning bid of 16 Bitcoin was made by an anonymous buyer. There was a brief confusion during the final minutes of the bidding when an error made it seem like $6.4 million was bid. However, this was soon recognized as a mistake, and the price was corrected. Langalis intends to use the proceeds from the auction to fund a Bitcoin software project."

4/24/2024,"Bitcoin Hasn't Reached New High In Three Years, Claims Veteran Trader Peter Brandt","According to U.Today, renowned trader Peter Brandt has sparked a debate with his recent assertion that Bitcoin has not reached a new all-time high (ATH) in the past three years. This statement may seem counterintuitive to many, given that Bitcoin reached its highest price level of $73,750.07 on March 14. However, Brandt argues that when adjusted for inflation, Bitcoin's price has not achieved a new high in three years. Brandt's argument is based on the metric of U.S. consumer purchasing power. Despite the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF and the recent Bitcoin halving event, Brandt believes that the cryptocurrency's price remains low when considering this factor. According to a chart he shared, Bitcoin last hit a high price in relation to consumers' buying power in the second half of 2021. Brandt, who has over 50 years of trading experience, expressed interest in hearing the perspectives of Bitcoin bears on the cryptocurrency's potential. He has been consistently vocal about his confidence in Bitcoin as an asset class, a stance that contrasts with his views on Ethereum ( ). In addition to Brandt, several other market investors and analysts have issued high price targets for Bitcoin. They anticipate that the spot Bitcoin ETF will trigger increased demand in the future, a trend that will be complemented by the reduced supply resulting from the halving. One such prediction came from 'Rich Dad Poor Dad' author Robert Kiyosaki, who forecasted that Bitcoin's price would exceed $100,000 by the end of this year."

4/24/2024,"Bitcoin's Average Dormancy Hits 13-Year High, Signaling Ownership Shift","According to U.Today, Bitcoin's average dormancy has reached a 13-year high, as per recent data shared by Ki Young Ju, the CEO of CryptoQuant. This increase in dormancy indicates a significant transfer of older Bitcoins to new holders, which could potentially reshape the cryptocurrency's ownership landscape. On March 23, Bitcoin's Average Dormancy reached a level of 227.684. Average Dormancy is a metric that represents the average number of 'destroyed days' of moved coins, calculated by dividing Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) by the total movement of coins. A higher Average Dormancy value typically suggests that long-term holders are moving or possibly selling their coins, which could indicate a potential price drop. The Average Dormancy of Bitcoin hitting a 13-year peak is significant for several reasons. Firstly, the increase implies that older, long-term holders of Bitcoin are either transferring their holdings or selling them to new investors. This shift could potentially alter the ownership distribution of Bitcoin, with new participants gaining a larger share of the market. Secondly, historically, spikes in Average Dormancy have often been followed by increased price volatility. If long-term holders are indeed selling or transferring their coins, it may lead to a greater supply of Bitcoin on the market, potentially putting downward pressure on prices. Lastly, the rising Average Dormancy could also reflect changing market sentiment among Bitcoin holders. Long-term investors may be responding to macroeconomic factors, regulatory changes, or other market dynamics that influence their decision to hold or sell their assets. Ki Young Ju's observation about the shifting cap table for Bitcoin underscores the evolving nature of the market. As older Bitcoins are transferred or sold to new holders, the ownership dynamics of Bitcoin are undergoing a significant transformation. Market participants should closely monitor these developments, as they could have far-reaching implications for market sentiment in the coming months."
4/24/2024,US Traditional Finance Firms Increase Crypto Portfolio Allocation,"According to CryptoPotato, traditional finance firms in the United States are increasingly incorporating crypto into their portfolios. This trend is evident in the growing allocation to crypto investment products. Two U.S. investment advisors, Legacy Wealth Asset Management and United Capital Management, based in Minnesota and Kansas respectively, have allocated 6% and 5% of their portfolios to the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC). These asset management firms have each invested over $20 million into FBTC, surpassing the $17 million that a competitor invested into BlackRock’s ETF, IBIT. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas referred to these allocations as a 'new high water mark' for investment into Bitcoin ETFs. He also suggested that this trend could be a concern for skeptics, but a positive sign for those hoping for long-term adoption. Balchunas also noted that this trend is likely to continue, with potentially 500-1000 firms reporting similar holdings in the coming weeks. He also highlighted that this is just one reporting season, with four in a year. The $40.8 million investment in FBTC has boosted spot Bitcoin ETF inflows, offsetting outflows from the previous week. Data from CoinGlass shows that the funds experienced an outflow streak for four consecutive trading days last week, with inflows only recorded on Friday. On Monday, the spot Bitcoin ETF market recorded inflows of $62.2 million, with FBTC seeing the highest of more than $34.8 million. In related news, the Stanford Blyth Fund, a student-run investment fund, allocated an even higher portion of its portfolio to Bitcoin, with a 7% allocation following a Bitcoin purchase."
4/24/2024,SkyBridge Capital Founder Emphasizes Importance of Bitcoin Ownership,"According to U.Today, Anthony Scaramucci, the founder of SkyBridge Capital, recently emphasized the importance of owning Bitcoin in a post on his Twitter account. He highlighted that owning Bitcoin is no longer a matter of courage, but rather a 'question of brains'. Scaramucci's comments come in the wake of significant developments in the Bitcoin market, including the creation of spot ETFs and the recent halving event. Scaramucci's tweet sparked a lively discussion among his followers, with many expressing their satisfaction with holding Bitcoin. However, one user questioned Scaramucci's investment in the FTC exchange, asking whether it was 'guts or brains' that motivated his decision. In related news, Samson Mow, former Blockstream CSO and current CEO at Jan3, recently spoke to Forbes about the impact of the Bitcoin halving and his expectations for 'Omega candles'. Mow explained that halvings, which occur every four years, make Bitcoin more deflationary compared to fiat currencies and extend the issuance of on the market. Before the halving, ETFs were purchasing between 5x and 15x the amount of Bitcoin produced by miners per day, creating a 'demand shock' for Bitcoin. Mow now anticipates the emergence of Omega candles, which are major trading candles that signify high volatility and significant shifts in the Bitcoin price. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $66,392, marking a nearly 9% increase since the halving day."

4/24/2024,Bitcoin's Potential to Surpass Gold's Market Capitalization Explored by Analyst,"According to U.Today, Bitcoin analyst Willy Woo has sparked a discussion within the cryptocurrency community about the possibility of Bitcoin exceeding gold's market capitalization of $17.7 trillion. 's analysis focuses on the stock-to- (S2F) ratio, Bitcoin's inflationary path, and the growing trend of institutional adoption. Central to Woo's argument is the S2F model, a measure that assesses an asset's scarcity by comparing its current supply to its annual production. With Bitcoin's inflation rate now lower than gold's, Woo suggests that the cryptocurrency is well-positioned to challenge the supremacy of the precious metal as a store-of-value asset. However, also cautioned that it could take 5 to 10 years for Bitcoin's market capitalization to match its S2F valuation. He attributed this delay to several factors, including the slow integration of Bitcoin into institutional portfolios, the creation of regulatory frameworks, and the establishment of custody solutions. Despite this cautious outlook, Woo highlighted the potential for retail investors who can self-custody their Bitcoin holdings to benefit from the S2F model sooner. He suggested a divergence between institutional and retail adoption timelines, implying that the latter might adopt Bitcoin's value proposition more quickly. As the possibility of Bitcoin's market cap reaching $17 trillion is considered, questions remain about the potential effects on the cryptocurrency's price dynamics in the meantime. Could the perceived delay between Bitcoin's intrinsic value and its market capitalization lead to increased volatility or speculative trading patterns? And how might external factors such as regulatory developments and macroeconomic trends influence its trajectory relative to gold?"
4/24/2024,BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF IBIT Records Impressive Performance,"According to PANews, BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF, known as IBIT, has been performing exceptionally well, as per the insights shared by Bloomberg's senior ETF analyst, Eric Balchunas. The ETF has managed to capture 24% of the total inflow of all BlackRock ETFs globally, standing out among its 1000 ETFs. Currently, the total assets managed by IBIT exceed $18 billion, second only to Grayscale's fund. Furthermore, data from The Block indicates that the cumulative trading volume of all Bitcoin ETFs is nearing $230 billion. This suggests that these financial products have garnered significant attention from investors. Balchunas mentioned these figures during an online panel discussion about the recently approved spot cryptocurrency ETF in Hong Kong. He stated that this achievement has even caught the attention of BlackRock's CEO, Larry Fink. Since its listing in the United States in January this year, the IBIT ETF has consistently attracted capital inflows for over 70 days, making it one of the most successful exchange-traded funds in history."
4/24/2024,Bitwise CIO Predicts Five Developments in Bitcoin Before Next Halving,"According to Foresight News, Matt Hougan, Chief Information Officer at Bitwise, has made five predictions about Bitcoin before its next halving, which is expected to occur in April 2028. Hougan's forecasts focus on reducing volatility, increasing portfolio allocation and exchange-traded fund flows, central bank participation, and a Bitcoin price target exceeding $250,000 in the coming years. Hougan anticipates a decrease in Bitcoin's volatility, which has been a significant concern for many investors. He also predicts an increase in portfolio allocation towards Bitcoin, suggesting that more investors will include the cryptocurrency in their investment portfolios. This increase in allocation is expected to be accompanied by a rise in exchange-traded fund flows. Another significant prediction made by Hougan is the involvement of central banks in Bitcoin. While the specifics of this involvement remain unclear, it indicates a potential shift in the traditional financial system's approach to cryptocurrencies. Lastly, Hougan predicts that the price of Bitcoin will exceed $250,000 in the next few years, a significant increase from its current value."

Eric Balchunas has confirmed that Hong Kong has greenlit Bitcoin and Ether ETFs for spot trading, starting on April 30th. The ETFs' fees are competitively set at 30bps, 60bps, and 99bps, which is lower than anticipated - a positive development. This signals a potential price war among Hong Kong's Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Harvest, a leading competitor, has the edge with a full fee waiver and the lowest fee at 0.3% after the waiver. Considering the tables provided by his colleagues, Rebecca Sin and the Trinian analyst, this could mark the beginning of a significant shift in Hong Kong's cryptocurrency market, with potential ripple effects on global cryptocurrency trading."

As of April 24, Australia boasts an active network of 1,002 Bitcoin ATMs, making it the third nation after the United States and Canada to achieve this feat. Representing 2.7% of the global Bitcoin ATM network, Australia's growth mirrors the trajectory of the US, which had its first 1,000 crypto ATMs come online back in November 2017, and Canada, which reached this level in January 2021. The total number of Bitcoin ATMs installed in Australia over time. Source: Coin ATM Radar The US currently has the lion's share of Bitcoin ATMs, hosting 82.8% of the global number with 31,170 machines, while Canada has 7.8% of the total with 2,918 crypto ATMs. Historically, the Australian market was relatively inactive when it comes to crypto ATMs. But since late 2022, there has been an exponential increase in adoption due to participation from private companies. Interestingly, in April 2023, Australia's Bitcoin ATM count surpassed that of Asia, which includes major economies like China, Japan, Singapore, and India.

4/25/2024,Bitcoin Moves Closer to Launching Rollups for Enhanced Smart Contract Functionality,"According to CryptoPotato, blockchain developers are nearing the launch of rollups on Bitcoin, which could provide the original cryptocurrency network with 'unlimited smart contract functionality' and scaling capabilities. BitcoinOS recently released the whitepaper for 'BitSNARK and Grail', a system designed to connect Bitcoin to layer 2 rollups and blockchains in a trust-minimized manner. This new rollup system is a development of BitVM, a Bitcoin-based computing paradigm discovered by Robin Linus in the previous year. BitVM's most significant application was its ability to verify 'Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge' (SNARKs) on Bitcoin, which paved the way for Bitcoin Rollup Bridges and scaling technologies similar to Optimism or Arbitrum on Ethereum. BitSNARK, built on BitVM, uses a software library specifically optimized for this purpose, enabling bridges that are cost-effective, efficient, and secure enough for practical use. 'This is a solution to Bitcoin’s trilemma of scale, computational expressivity, and decentralization,' Edan Yago, one of the paper’s authors, posted on Twitter. He added that no softfork, upgrades, or new -codes are necessary for this development. Existing Bitcoin layer 2 systems have faced significant tradeoffs compared to scaling systems built on more expressive blockchains like Ethereum. For instance, Bitcoin’s lightning network can become impractical for individual use due to the cost and complexity of channel management. Additionally, Bitcoin sidechains like Liquid and Rootstock require a federation of third parties to manage the 'bridge' between L1 and L2, representing a single point of failure for both chains. The new system, Grail, uses BitSNARK to generate SNARK proofs for Bitcoin and rollup transactions, enabling secure asset transfers between L1 and L2 rollups. The Grail bridge requires at least two operators to function, but theoretically, any number could be supported. The BitcoinOS team is currently aiming to design a bridge with over 100 operators. 'The trust assumption works unless all parties collude,' Yago added. 'That’s what makes it so strong.'"

4/25/2024,"Inactive Bitcoin Wallets Hold 1.8 Million Coins, No Direct Correlation With Price Moves","According to U.Today, a recent report by Fortune, citing data from blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis, reveals that approximately 1.8 million Bitcoins, equivalent to $121 billion, are held in wallets that have been inactive for over a decade. These dormant coins represent 8.5% of Bitcoin's 19.7 million circulating supply. The report does not clarify what proportion of these cryptocurrencies are lost forever, but it suggests that the total number of such coins should stabilize around 1.5 million. Earlier this month, a Satoshi-era whale, a term used for a large holder of Bitcoin, became active after a decade of inactivity, holding $115 million. When such wallets become active after a long period of dormancy, it is often assumed that the owners might want to take profits following a price rally. However, the report indicates that there is no direct correlation between the activation of long-dormant wallets and significant price movements. Chainalysis has observed that old wallets tend to be activated at a relatively predictable rate. The majority of these wallets do not usually make headlines due to their small size. In fact, 99% of all wallets considered lost contain less than 50 , equivalent to $3.2 million at current prices. Data from Glassnode shows that over 68% of Bitcoin's total circulating supply has been inactive for more than a year. This decrease in supply available on the market could be a bullish development, considering the growing demand following the approval of several Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in January. The largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, is currently trading at $64,810 on major spot exchanges."

4/25/2024,BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF Records First Day with Zero Inflows,"According to Cointelegraph: BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) encountered its first day of $0 inflow since the introduction of Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in the United States in January. According to data from Farside, the previously consistent inflow into IBIT halted on April 24. Since its inception on January 11, IBIT has continually pulled in daily investments worth millions of dollars, accumulating nearly $15.5 billion in just 71 days. However, on April 24, the inflow streak paused with $0 recorded. The majority of other Bitcoin ETF players also witnessed such a dry spell. Out of the 11 U.S.-registered Bitcoin ETFs, only Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) and ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) reported inflows of $5.6 million and $4.2 million, respectively. Meanwhile, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC) continued to experience outflows. On April 24, GBTC reported $130.4 million in outflows. In turn, spot Bitcoin ETFs realized a net outflow of $120.6 million on the day. A lack of inflows, while a first for IBIT, is not unique among other ETF participants. Fidelity's FBTC, for instance, has seen three days of $0 inflows in the past two weeks. The U.S. Bitcoin ETF market has, to date, accumulated a net total of $12.3 billion in Bitcoin. However, the hefty outflows from GBTC have offset some of these inflows. On a different note, several Bitcoin ETF market participants are currently seeking to apply for Ether ETFs in the United States. The approval decisions for these applications have recently been postponed by the Securities and Exchange Commission."

Source: TradingView According to data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView, BTC's price action is attempting to form support at $64,000 before Wall Street's opening. This decline comes after a drop to around $63,575 at the previous day's closing due to renewed Middle East tensions. Latest statistics from monitoring platform CoinGlass indicate an increased liquidity on both the buy and sell side of the spot price on various crypto exchanges. Bitcoin liquidation heatmap (screenshot). Source: CoinGlass Importantly, a substantial volume of sell orders has appeared, beginning with around $75 million at $64,765 and escalating up to $67,700. Comparatively, the local low at $63,500 saw limited buying interest. Famed trader Daan Crypto Trades underscored the ""healthy"" state of funding rates, suggesting it as a foundation for a slow but consistent rise in BTC's price going forward. Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States reverted to net outflows on April 24, mainly driven by withdrawals from Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), according to sources including UK-based investment firm Farside. Bitcoin's sensitivity to geopolitical events and the subsequent impact on price action remind traders of the inherent volatility and risk associated with cryptocurrency investment."
4/25/2024,"BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF Ends 71-Day Inflow Streak, Crypto Market Appears Bearish","According to U.Today, BlackRock's Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) has ended its 71-day streak of consecutive inflows. On Wednesday, the fund, known as IBIT, failed to attract any new inflows, while total outflows reached $120 million. In contrast, Grayscale's GBTC continues to experience significant outflows, losing more than $130 million in a single day. Fidelity's FBTC and 's ARKB saw modest inflows of $5.6 million and $4.2 million respectively, but these were not enough to offset Grayscale's losses. On Tuesday, BlackRock's IBIT recorded $10 million worth of inflows. Many traders track ETF flows to gauge market sentiment, so the lack of fresh inflows into BlackRock's fund on Wednesday could be interpreted as a bearish signal for the market, at least in the short term. However, it's important to note that these ETFs initially attracted stronger-than-expected inflows following their launch. The ETF has now reached $20 billion in assets under management (AUM). For comparison, the SPDR Gold ETF (GLD) took almost three years to reach the same milestone. Despite the total AUM of GLD being almost three times larger, IBIT has surpassed GLD in daily trading volume. It's common for ETFs to stop attracting flows once they reach a certain size, and BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF has managed to record one of the longest streaks of inflows. However, it still falls short of funds such as the JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF (JEPI) and the Pacer US Cash Cows 100 ETF (COWZ). Despite the implications of IBIT's now-interrupted inflow streak, the overall sentiment in the crypto market appears to be bearish. The price of Bitcoin has fallen more than 3% over the past 24 hours, and is currently trading at $64,329."

Checkmate, on-chain analyst, proclaimed the situation as one of the ""healthiest market resets"" seen in a long span. The higher funding rates signal a surge in long trade interest, indicating a bullish market atmosphere.

4/25/2024,Bitcoin Traders Scale Back Bets Amid Market Moderation,"According to Bloomberg, Bitcoin traders seem to have reduced their bets on the world's largest cryptocurrency as its two major driving forces diminish. On April 19, the Bitcoin funding rate, which is the premium paid by traders to open new long positions in the token's perpetual futures market, turned negative for the first time since October 2023. This metric indicates a decrease in Bitcoin demand following a period where a series of US spot-Bitcoin ETFs pushed the token to record highs. However, net inflows to these ETFs have decreased in recent weeks. The much-anticipated halving, a quadrennial event that cuts the rewards earned by miners that secure the blockchain and reduces the supply of new coins in the market, had a minimal effect on Bitcoin's price last week. Bitcoin reached a peak of $73,798 in March but has since corrected nearly 13%, trading at $64,214 as of 08:35 a.m. on Thursday in London. The enthusiasm of buyers for the original cryptocurrency has cooled partly due to increasing risk aversion linked to tensions in the Middle East, as well as expected delays to Federal Reserve rate cuts. Bitcoin funding rates reached a three-year high in March, indicating an overheated market, but were below zero as of Tuesday. Julio Moreno, CryptoQuant’s Head of Research, stated that this certainly means that the desire for traders to open long positions has eased. Vetle Lunde, an analyst at K33 Research, noted that the current 11-day neutral-to-below-neutral funding rate streak is unusual, with past dips promptly followed by a flurry of leveraged bets. He added that the lengthy nature of this perp discount could point toward further price consolidation. The drop-off in the funding rate coincides with a decline in daily inflows into the US spot-Bitcoin ETFs. So far this month, the group of 11 products has seen a net inflow of $170 million, significantly less than the $4 billion they garnered in the same number of trading days in March, according to data compiled by Bloomberg."
4/25/2024,"Bitcoin Faces Potential Downward Pressure, Warns Crypto Analyst","According to U.Today, Bitcoin's price, currently hovering around the $63,800 mark, has investors on edge as crypto analyst Ali Martinez points out a worrying pattern on the charts. Martinez's recent analysis of the leading cryptocurrency's performance reveals two significant sell signals, suggesting possible downward pressure on Bitcoin. The first signal is the appearance of a 'death cross' between the 50 and 100 Simple Moving Averages (SMA) on the Bitcoin 12-hour chart. This ominous pattern takes place when the short-term moving average, in this case, the 50-day one, crosses below the long-term moving average of 100 or 200 days. Historically, the death cross has been seen as a bearish indicator, hinting at a potential shift in momentum from bullish to bearish sentiment. Adding to the worry is the emergence of a red 9 candlestick from the TD Sequential indicator. This tool, developed by market analyst Thomas DeMark, is used in technical analysis to identify potential price exhaustion and trend reversals. In this situation, the red 9 candlestick implies that Bitcoin's upward momentum might be waning, potentially setting the stage for a corrective move. If Bitcoin fails to maintain above the critical support level of $63,300, investors might need to prepare for further downside. Martinez cautions that a breach of this level could pave the way for Bitcoin to test lower support zones at $61,000 or even $59,000. The current price of Bitcoin, down 16% from its all-time high, further emphasizes the uncertainty in the cryptocurrency markets. As crypto enthusiasts closely watch the evolving price action, all eyes are now on whether Bitcoin will succumb to the ominous signals of the impending death cross or defy expectations with a bullish resurgence."

4/25/2024,"Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Hits Record High, According to BTC.com Data","According to BlockBeats, Bitcoin mining difficulty has reached a new historical high. The data from BTC.com shows that the mining difficulty was adjusted by 1.99% to 88.1 T at block height 840,672 on April 25, 2024. The current average network hashrate stands at 642.78 EH/s. The adjustment in mining difficulty is a significant event in the Bitcoin network. It is a measure of how difficult it is to find a new block compared to the easiest it can ever be. The difficulty is adjusted every 2016 blocks, or approximately every two weeks, to maintain the block discovery rate at one every 10 minutes. When more miners join the network, the difficulty increases. Conversely, if miners start to leave, the difficulty decreases. The recent increase in mining difficulty to a record high indicates that more computational power is being invested in securing the Bitcoin network. This could be a sign of increased confidence in the future of Bitcoin, as miners are willing to invest more resources in mining activities. However, it also means that mining Bitcoin has become more challenging, potentially discouraging smaller players from participating. The average network hashrate of 642.78 EH/s is a measure of the processing power of the entire Bitcoin network. When the network reaches this rate, it is capable of making 642.78 quintillion attempts per second to solve the mathematical problem that allows a miner to add a new block to the blockchain. This high hashrate indicates a high level of security for the Bitcoin network, as it would require an enormous amount of computational power to launch a successful attack. In conclusion, the recent adjustment in Bitcoin mining difficulty and the high network hashrate reflect the robustness and security of the Bitcoin network. However, the increased difficulty could pose challenges for smaller miners."

4/26/2024,"US Economy In Depression, Bitcoin To Skyrocket: Robert Kiyosaki","According to U.Today, renowned financial expert and Bitcoin investor, Robert Kiyosaki, has expressed his views on the current state of the U.S. economy. Kiyosaki, the author of the classic finance management book 'Rich Dad Poor Dad', stated that the U.S. economy is in a state of depression, defined as an economy experiencing subpar growth. He pointed out that while the economy may be growing, it is doing so below its potential. Kiyosaki highlighted that the economy grew by 3.4% in the last quarter of 2023, but in the first quarter of 2024, it grew by less than half of that, at 1.6%. He believes that there will not be a soft landing for the U.S. economy, but remains optimistic as the economy continues to grow. He also urged his followers to disregard fake news. In response to Kiyosaki's statement, members of various cryptocurrency communities shared their thoughts. Some suggested that the definition of a depression should be revised based on Kiyosaki's explanation, while others criticized the author. A majority of the comments were positive, with many praising Bitcoin and expressing gratitude for Kiyosaki's insights. In addition to his views on the economy, Kiyosaki has also made predictions about Bitcoin. Earlier this year, he stated that he expected Bitcoin to reach $100,000 by September. He cited the Bitcoin halving event, which occurred in April, as a major driver for this anticipated price increase. Kiyosaki also revealed plans to purchase an additional 10 Bitcoins before the halving, in anticipation of a significant price rise."
4/26/2024,Hong Kong Exchange To Commence Trading Bitcoin And Ethereum Spot ETFs,"According to Foresight News, the Hong Kong Exchange (HKEX) is set to start trading Bitcoin and Ethereum spot Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) managed by Harvest Fund Management. The trading is scheduled to commence on April 30th. The market news indicates that this move by the HKEX is a significant step towards the mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies. The introduction of Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs by Harvest Fund Management on the HKEX platform will provide investors with a new avenue to invest in these digital assets. This development is expected to have a positive impact on the overall cryptocurrency market, as it could potentially attract more investors to the sector. However, it is important to note that the performance of these ETFs will be closely tied to the price movements of Bitcoin and Ethereum."

4/26/2024,Grayscale Bitcoin Trust Sets Unusual Record for ETF Outflows,"According to U.Today, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) has set a unique record as a global Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) product with an unusually high underperformance. Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas reported that GBTC has sustained a 72-day outflow streak, a record unmatched by any other known ETF in the industry. This trend has been ongoing since spot Bitcoin ETFs were approved in the United States in January, with investors consistently withdrawing funds, albeit at varying rates. Balchunas's statement has sparked reactions from the community, with many attributing GBTC's underperformance to the firm's fee decisions. At its inception, while other issuers set a minimal fee, Grayscale announced it would charge 1.5%, a significant amount compared to the average 0.2% charged by its competing ETF issuers. Grayscale executives defended this decision, arguing that GBTC's legacy and the expertise of its team would render the fees insignificant in the long run. However, current data trends are being viewed as a major red flag that may not bode well for Grayscale in the near future. The spot Bitcoin ETF market appears to be gradually losing momentum. This observation is based on the recent break in the stellar performance of BlackRock’s IBIT. The Bitcoin ETF recorded its first halt in inflow earlier this week, indicating a potential shift away from risk assets. This drop coincided with a period of intense bearish volatility in the price of Bitcoin. At the time of writing, the premier asset is trading at $63,628.56, down by 2.1% in the past 24 hours. Given the bearish Bitcoin outlook, the short-term trends of and their potential impact on GBTC remain uncertain."

4/26/2024,Bitcoin Whales and Long-Term Holders Realize Profits Amidst Bull Run,"According to CryptoPotato, Bitcoin whales are reportedly cashing in on their profits from the recent Bitcoin rally. On-chain analysts have noticed a significant increase in inflows to centralized cryptocurrency exchanges, with a substantial portion of these inflows coming from Bitcoin whales. This information was revealed in a CryptoQuant Quicktake by anonymous crypto analyst Phi Deltalytics. On April 25, another analyst, Woominkyu, noted that the unrealized profits of long-term Bitcoin whales had increased significantly, particularly with Bitcoin's value exceeding $60,000. Despite the increase in profits, Woominkyu observed that these whales had not yet cashed out. He pointed out a spot on his chart indicating a significant rise in unrealized profits, suggesting that this group of Bitcoin investors was maintaining their positions. However, he also warned that any move to realize these profits could impact the market. Approximately 24 hours after Woominkyu's post, Phi Deltalytics reported a notable increase in Bitcoin exchange inflow, with the majority seemingly coming from whales. He suggested that this increase could indicate significant profit-taking by whales during the ongoing 2024 Bitcoin bull run. While he acknowledged that such metrics can sometimes produce false signals, he advised caution when interpreting market dynamics. In addition to Bitcoin whales, long-term holders of the digital asset have also been cashing out. Woominkyu noted that the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) of long-term holders had surpassed that of short-term holders over a seven-day moving average, indicating that the former group is realizing more profits. He also explained that the SOPR of long-term holders has generally decreased over time, but there are instances when it experiences an uptick, often preceding spikes in Bitcoin's price. These upticks suggest that long-term investors are capitalizing on price surges to realize profits. Investors are advised to be cautious of potential price corrections and increased volatility, as the SOPR is currently high. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is consolidating between $60,000 and $70,000. If it rallies to $70,000 and gets rejected, the cryptocurrency could experience a significant slump. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $64,100, with negligible gains or losses in the past 24 hours."

4/26/2024,Bitcoin Price Stays Resilient Amid Rising ETF Liquidations and Regulatory Uncertainties,"According to Cointelegraph: Bitcoin ( ) Price Holds Steady Against Regulatory Turbulence and Spot ETF Outflows Despite dealing with a series of negative factors, including substantial outflows from spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and amplified regulatory scrutiny, Bitcoin ( ) was able to maintain a value above $63,000 on April 26. U.S.-based spot Bitcoin ( ) ETFs reported a considerable net outflow of $218 million on April 25, following $120 million outflow the previous day, according to Farside Investors. Franklin Templeton was the only provider recording inflows on April 25, implying that this withdrawal trend was not entirely induced by high fees at Grayscale's GBTC. Source: Geiger Capital In addition, US Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bill Cassidy sent a letter to the Department of Justice and Department of Homeland Security on April 25, requesting information on measures adopted to combat pseudonymous cryptocurrency payments for illicit child abuse material. Bitcoin ( ) enthusiasts, however, are showing optimism despite deteriorating global economic conditions. The U.S. Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) rose by 2.8% year-on-year in March. Given that the U.S. GDP growth for Q1 was below expectations at 1.6%, this level of inflation, surpassing the Federal Reserve’s target, is concerning. With these metrics, market expectations that the Fed will sustain higher interest rates for an extended duration are growing. Amid this challenging economic landscape, Bitcoin participants remain cautious about the unsustainable path of the U.S. government's fiscal policy. Worsening macroeconomic conditions extend beyond the U.S. to other leading economies where similar issues could inadvertently strengthen Bitcoin's appeal. Ultimately, while Bitcoin's price has suffered from U.S. spot ETF outflows, regulatory stress, and global economic downturns, analysts suggest that weakened worldwide economic conditions may lead to additional central bank stimulus measures, which could enhance Bitcoin's prospects."

4/26/2024,Bitcoin Privacy and Omega Candles: Insights from Jan3 CEO Samson Mow,"According to U.Today, Samson Mow, CEO of Bitcoin adoption-focused company Jan3, recently engaged in a discussion about Bitcoin privacy and the identity of its pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. Mow quoted Nakamoto's statement from the Bitcoin white paper, which suggested an alternative method of maintaining privacy compared to traditional banking models. Nakamoto proposed keeping private keys anonymous, allowing transactions to be visible but not linked to any specific individual. Mow's comments sparked a response from Ledger CTO Charles Guillemet, who argued that 'Pseudonymity is a weak form of privacy.' Mow retorted by challenging Guillemet to reveal Nakamoto's real identity. In a separate conversation, Mow predicted the emergence of 'Omega Bitcoin candles,' a term referring to large greed trading candles associated with high volatility. He believes that the recent Bitcoin halving, which reduced block rewards from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC, will create a Bitcoin supply shock. This, coupled with the demand shock created by spot Bitcoin ETFs buying up BTC from the market, could lead to the appearance of Omega candles, potentially driving Bitcoin's value to the anticipated $1 million mark. Following the halving, Bitcoin's value increased by nearly 10% to reach $67,000. However, it has since declined by 3.76%, with Bitcoin currently trading in the $64,400 range."

4/27/2024,Bitcoin Creator Satoshi Nakamoto's Disappearance Marks 13th Anniversary,"According to U.Today, the mysterious disappearance of Bitcoin's pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, is marking its 13th anniversary. Nakamoto, who laid the foundation for Bitcoin's development and guided its early growth, abruptly ceased all communications and vanished in 2011. This event has remained one of the most enduring mysteries in the cryptocurrency world, leaving behind a legacy of innovation and speculation. On April 23, 2011, Nakamoto sent his final emails to fellow developers, stating he had 'moved on to other things' and that the cryptocurrency was in 'good hands.' Three days later, he completely disappeared. One of his final acts before disappearing was handing over a cryptographic key he had used to send network-wide alerts. This key was not just any piece of digital information, but a powerful symbol of trust and authority within the Bitcoin network, allowing Nakamoto to broadcast messages to all participants. The decision to relinquish this key was a clear message that Bitcoin was no longer under the control of its creator; it belonged to the community. This action aligns with Nakamoto's overarching vision for Bitcoin as a decentralized and trustless system, free from centralized control or authority. It symbolized the transition from centralized leadership to community-driven stewardship of the world's first cryptocurrency. Present-day Bitcoin operates as a decentralized system with no single, centralized location or controlling authority. Its technology and infrastructure do not rely on centralized entities, like banks and governments, to manage it. Nakamoto also removed his name from the software's copyright claim, releasing the source to all 'Bitcoin developers.'"

4/27/2024,"Bitcoin's Bull Market Cycles Losing Momentum, Suggests Trader Peter Brandt","According to U.Today, renowned trader Peter Brandt has recently published an analysis suggesting that Bitcoin's bull market cycles are gradually losing momentum. In his analysis, Brandt delves into the concept of exponential decay, indicating that each successive Bitcoin bull cycle has seen a diminishing exponential advance, with a loss of about 80% of the momentum from previous cycles. The current surge marks the fifth significant bull cycle in Bitcoin's history. Applying this trend to the current cycle, Brandt projects a potential peak of around $72,723, a figure already reached in recent trading. Despite acknowledging the historical impact of halving events on the Bitcoin price, he emphasizes the sobering reality of exponential decay. He suggests there's a 25% chance that Bitcoin may have already reached its peak for this cycle. In the event of a market top, Brandt speculates on potential price retracements, foreseeing a decline to the middle of $30,000 per Bitcoin or even revisiting lows from 2021. Despite the bearish implications, he views such a correction as potentially bullish in the long term, drawing parallels to similar chart patterns observed in the gold market. Brandt concludes his analysis by acknowledging the weight of the data, stating, 'Do I believe the analysis just presented? I don’t want to, but the data speak for itself.'"

It is the volatility inferred by substituting the actual option price and other parameters except volatility σ into the B-S option pricing formula. The actual price of the option is formed by the competition of many option traders. Therefore, implied volatility represents the market participants' views and expectations for the future market, and is considered to be the closest to the real volatility at that time."
4/27/2024,"Meme Coin Sector Sees Significant Growth, Analysts Remain Optimistic","According to CryptoPotato, the coin sector has seen substantial growth, with Dogecoin ( ) and Shiba Inu ( ) leading the pack. Newer tokens such as dogwifhat (WIF) and Pepe (PEPE) are also gaining traction due to strong community support. Analysts are optimistic about the potential of this sector, especially after the Bitcoin halving, which has historically triggered market surges. The meme coin sector has made significant progress during the latest bull cycle, with its market capitalization briefly surpassing $60 billion. This growth is largely due to popular assets like DOGE and SHIB, which remain trending among investors. Newer tokens, including , Bonk Inu ( ), and , are also gaining popularity. Currently, DOGE and SHIB account for over 60% of the sector's market capitalization, and they are the only meme coins to have ever crossed the $10 billion mark. The AI-powered chatbot, ChatGPT, was asked whether another coin could reach this milestone. It estimated that success could be driven by strong community support, a viral social media presence, and increased investor interest. WIF and PEPE are some of the meme coins that have gained a solid supporter base. The dogwifhat community recently raised $650,000 to put the token's logo on the Sphere, a famous entertainment arena in Las Vegas, Nevada. The token also received backing from prominent industry participants, such as Arthur Hayes. A study conducted a few months ago estimated that Shiba Inu has the strongest community base among meme coins, with and rounding out the top three. The frog-themed digital asset currently has a market cap of over $3 billion, making it a major contender among the leading ones. Analysts remain optimistic that the coin sector will continue to flourish during the bull cycle. One contributing factor could be the recent Bitcoin halving, which has historically been a precursor for a major resurgence in the entire cryptocurrency industry. Shiba Inu, in particular, is poised for a price ascent in the near future due to its aggressive burning mechanism, the development of the layer-2 scaling solution Shibarium, and the predominantly negative exchange netflow on a weekly scale."
4/27/2024,"Bitcoin's Future Growth Dependent on Spot ETFs, Says Ecoinometrics Report","According to CryptoPotato, a new report by Ecoinometrics suggests that the future growth of Bitcoin is heavily reliant on spot Bitcoin ETFs. The report indicates that these funds have ceased accumulating coins for over a month, which could potentially impact Bitcoin's future price trajectory. From January to mid-March, spot Bitcoin ETFs accumulated 200,000 , despite significant outflows from Grayscale. This accumulation coincided with Bitcoin's price surge from $40,000 to $75,000. However, the inflow of BTC into ETFs has since halted, leading to a stagnation in price movement. The report states, 'If you're wondering why Bitcoin is stuck in the $60k range, look no further. The ETFs have stopped accumulating coins for a while now. They are the only game in town. No demand from them means no price appreciation.' Despite this, Ecoinometrics advises investors not to lose sight of the bigger picture, asserting that Bitcoin is the only hedge investors need against debasement. The report also compared the performance of Bitcoin, gold, and the NASDAQ over the last decade, adjusted for the growth of the global monetary base. It found that while gold has remained flat, merely keeping pace with global liquidity, the NASDAQ has seen a threefold increase. However, Bitcoin has outperformed both by a significant margin, boasting a 44-fold increase in value. This underscores Bitcoin's effectiveness as a hedge in the current economic climate. However, there are counterarguments from industry experts. Crypto analytics platform Kaiko, for instance, argued that Bitcoin has failed to attract safe-haven flows even amidst increased demand for such assets due to the conflict in the Middle East."
4/27/2024,"Bitcoin Network Records New High with 927,000 Daily Transactions","According to CryptoPotato, the Bitcoin network has achieved a new milestone with its daily transactions peaking at 927,000. This surpasses the previous record of 724,000 set in December 2023. The surge in transactions is attributed to the launch of Runes, a new token standard on the Bitcoin blockchain. Since its introduction following the halving on April 20, Runes has accounted for over two-thirds of all Bitcoin transactions, with more than 2.38 million transactions processed, making up 68% of the total. The data, sourced from a Dune Analytics dashboard shared by blockchain research firm Crypto Koryo, shows the significant adoption and usage of Runes alongside traditional Bitcoin transactions. These include ordinary peer-to-peer transactions, BRC-20s, and Ordinals. Runes experienced its highest activity on April 23, surpassing 750,000 transactions. However, the following day saw a significant decrease, with the transaction count dropping to 312,000, less than half of the previous day’s total. The new protocol, introduced by Ordinals Creator Casey Rodarmor, is promoted as a more efficient way to generate tokens on the Bitcoin network compared to BRC-20. However, some industry experts have expressed concerns. Nikita Zhavoronkov from Blockchair, for instance, criticized the amount of block space Runes transactions are occupying, suggesting that Bitcoin has deviated from Satoshi Nakamoto’s original vision as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. The industry appears to be divided on whether Runes will offer a sustainable revenue source for Bitcoin miners."

The trading volume data is an important indicator of the market activity and investor interest in these Bitcoin spot ETFs. It can be used to gauge the popularity and liquidity of these investment products. The high trading volumes of these Bitcoin spot ETFs indicate a strong interest from investors and a vibrant market activity."
4/27/2024,MicroStrategy Chairman Urges Perspective Amid Bitcoin Price Fluctuations,"According to U.Today, MicroStrategy Chairman Michael Saylor has stressed the need for maintaining perspective and focus in the face of Bitcoin's recent price fluctuations. Bitcoin, which reached a peak of $73,798 in mid-March, has since corrected by approximately 13%, with a 1.34% rise in the last 24 hours to $64,335. Earlier this week, Bitcoin experienced a drop from highs of $67,225 recorded on April 23. In a related development, investors pulled out a net $218 million from U.S. Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, marking one of the largest daily outflows. This was triggered by a reduced demand for risky assets, as optimism for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts waned. As Bitcoin's latest price movement settles, Saylor's advice resonates with those looking beyond the immediate horizon. His call to 'keep an eye on the ball' is seen as a mindset for navigating the volatile landscape of cryptocurrencies."
4/27/2024,MicroStrategy Founder Michael Saylor Discusses Bitcoin Creator's Tactics,"According to U.Today, Michael Saylor, the founder of MicroStrategy and a vocal Bitcoin supporter, recently shared his thoughts on the tactics of Bitcoin's mysterious creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. Saylor's comments sparked a wave of reactions from the crypto community, with many expressing support and admiration for both Saylor and Bitcoin. Saylor tweeted, 'Satoshi created a way, gave it away, and walked away,' which was met with responses such as 'That's the way,' 'A lesson to be learned in this! Study #Bitcoin and keep your head down,' and 'A very selfless act.' However, not all responses were positive. Some criticized the current state of Bitcoin after Nakamoto left it in the hands of the core developers. Critics also targeted Saylor, with comments like 'And people like you ruined it,' 'He created a way, did not give it away and never walked away. you are still new in this,' and 'And then btc core devs manipulated by malicious state actors changed it from p2p cash to a settlement network.' In related news, Samson Mow, the CEO of Jan3, a company focused on helping nation-states adopt Bitcoin, recently quoted the Bitcoin white paper written by Nakamoto. Mow highlighted Bitcoin's ability to maintain privacy, contrasting it with traditional banking methods. According to Nakamoto's white paper, Bitcoin keeps public keys anonymous, allowing the public to see that a transaction is taking place without linking it to any individual."
4/27/2024,Bitcoin ETFs Experience Significant Outflows Amid Market Volatility,"According to U.Today, Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have seen a net withdrawal of $218 million, marking one of the largest outflows in the sector's history. On Thursday, Bitcoin funds experienced an overall outflow of $218 million, including a $23 million drawdown for the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund. This was the first such event since the fund started trading on January 11, alongside peers such as BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust. BlackRock's fund, on Wednesday, ended a 71-day streak of continuous inflows. The group of over a dozen ETFs, which had been breaking records on its way to amassing combined assets of around $54 billion, has recently seen a decrease in demand. Bitcoin ETFs, which offer investors the opportunity to gain exposure to Bitcoin without the complexities of direct ownership, have been a popular choice among both experienced and novice investors. However, the recent outflow could signal a change in investor sentiment. The timing of the outflow coincides with a period of increased volatility in the cryptocurrency markets, characterized by sharp price swings. Bitcoin dropped to lows of $62,747 in Thursday's trading as demand for riskier investments was dampened by waning optimism for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was up 0.86% in the last 24 hours to $64,498, down from a record high of $73,798 set in mid-March. Despite the outflow from U.S. Bitcoin ETFs, the long-term outlook for Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market remains positive. Increased institutional acceptance and continued interest from regular investors are driving market development and innovation. While short-term fluctuations are expected, market participants remain optimistic about the long-term potential of Bitcoin and digital assets."
4/27/2024,DTCC Stops Accepting Bitcoin and Other Cryptocurrencies as Collateral,"According to BlockBeats, the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) has announced that it will no longer accept Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrencies as collateral for ETFs or other investment tools from April 30. The assets will be considered as 100% write-off, implying that market makers will need to provide more margin. This information was analyzed by the cryptocurrency research institution, 10x Research. 10x Research has pointed out that the price of Bitcoin is creating lower highs, and a new downward trend seems to be forming. In this context, the statement by DTCC could have a significant impact. On April 4, 10x Research had analyzed a 'self-reinforcing Bitcoin mechanism' framework, suggesting the risk of ETF capital inflows reversing to some extent."
4/28/2024,Prominent Crypto Trader Spots Bearish Signal on Bitcoin's Daily Chart,"According to U.Today, Josh Olszewicz, a renowned cryptocurrency trader, has identified a Tenkan/Kijun crossover on Bitcoin's daily chart, which could potentially signal the onset of a bearish trend. The Tenkan Sen is calculated by dividing the highest high and the lowest low in price over the past nine periods. This line often acts as a short-term support level during an uptrend, suggesting that the price might find some buying interest at this point. Conversely, it can also serve as a short-term resistance level if a particular asset is in a downtrend. The Kijun Sen, also known as the base line, is determined by adding the highest high and the lowest low over the past 27 periods and dividing this sum by two. This base line can function as a medium-term support level. The relationship between these two lines could offer crucial signals to traders about the current market condition. The Tenkan Sen crossing below the Kijun Sen is generally viewed as a bearish indicator, as it suggests that the market is yielding to bearish pressure. However, this signal may not necessarily spell the end for the bullish trend, as the crossover occurred below the Ichimoku cloud. At the time of reporting, Bitcoin is trading at $63,645, according to data from CoinGecko. It's worth noting that Bitcoin is currently underperforming against Ethereum, which has seen a surge of approximately 6% in the last 24 hours."

This will allow developers to build OP_CAT applications using CatVM and conduct real-time testing on the official test network. Signet is the name of the Bitcoin test network designed for developers to test their software. It operates without miners and does not require proof of work, creating a block every 10 minutes on average."
4/28/2024,Bitcoin's Fourth Halving and the Impact of ETF Developments,"According to CryptoPotato, Bitcoin's fourth halving has taken place, reducing the block rewards to 3.125 . Despite the historical significance of this event as a catalyst for a new bull cycle, there is ongoing debate about the diminishing effects of this halving. However, there are several other positive developments in the Bitcoin sector that could stimulate interest in the coming months. In mid-January, the US Securities and Exchange Commission approved nearly a dozen spot Bitcoin ETFs to begin trading on local exchanges. This is arguably the most positive news this year. These products, led by BlackRock's IBIT and Fidelity's FBTC, attracted billions of dollars worth of BTC in just a few months. This demand led to a significant increase in spot BTC prices, with the cryptocurrency nearly doubling its USD value and reaching a new all-time high before the halving for the first time. However, as the inflows began to decrease and even turned negative on some occasions, BTC's price growth was halted, and the asset fell by about ten thousand dollars from its March peaks. Reports suggest that these ETFs are crucial for Bitcoin's continued growth as an asset. BNY Mellon, one of the oldest and largest banking organizations in the United States, recently revealed its exposure to some of the spot ETFs trading locally. BNY has been a long-time supporter of the cryptocurrency industry, even when most US banks were publicly criticizing or ignoring it. Another positive development related to the US ETF market came from Morgan Stanley. The Wall Street giant is reportedly considering allowing its 15,000 brokers to recommend clients to purchase spot Bitcoin ETF funds. While the US demand may be slowing down, there are more positive developments from other jurisdictions. Hong Kong is prepared to launch its own spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs soon, even though the impact will likely be smaller due to the market's size compared to the US. Analysts such as Lark Davis believe the launch of spot ETFs in Hong Kong will create a 'massive ripple effect' across the entire Asian continent, with more countries expected to follow suit."
4/28/2024,"Bitcoin Whale Activity Declines, Impact on BTC Price Speculated","According to U.Today, a notable decrease in Bitcoin whale activity has been observed since March 14 by renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez. This has led to speculation about the potential influence on Bitcoin's price. Martinez's study shows a significant reduction in transactions involving amounts over $100,000, following Bitcoin's rise to a new peak of $73,750 per . Martinez's data reveals that in the last 24 hours, transactions over $100,000 amounted to 2,896, while those surpassing $1 million totaled 521. Before Bitcoin's peak, whale activity showed a proportional increase, peaking at around 4,500 daily transactions valued at a million dollars or more, and approximately 24,500 transactions exceeding $100,000. Martinez suggests that the lack of significant whale activity could be contributing to Bitcoin's recent price stagnation, as the cryptocurrency struggles to maintain momentum amid decreasing volatility. The analyst's observations raise questions about the role of large-scale investors in influencing market dynamics, especially considering their reduced participation. The drop in whale activity represents a divergence from previous patterns, where increased transaction volumes by major players often coincided with significant price movements. Martinez's evaluation suggests the possibility of a resurgence in whale transactions serving as a trigger for renewed bullish sentiment in the Bitcoin market. As investors and crypto enthusiasts closely monitor Bitcoin's movements, all eyes are now on whether the reemergence of whale activity will indeed serve as the catalyst for a bullish trend in the crypto market."
4/28/2024,Iconic 'Buy Bitcoin' Sign Auctioned for Over $1 Million,"According to CryptoPotato, a notebook paper with the phrase 'Buy Bitcoin,' which gained fame during a 2017 broadcast featuring then-US Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, has been auctioned for 16 , approximately $1.027 million. The took place at PubKey, a Bitcoin-themed in New York City, and was organized by auction house Scarce.City. The highest bidder, known pseudonymously as 'Squirrekkywrath,' won the sign in a week-long auction. Christian Langalis, also known as the 'Bitcoin Sign Guy,' organized the auction and attended the event. Scarce.City reported that the transaction set a record for the platform. After the platform's 15% fee, Langalis is expected to receive around $875,000, equivalent to 13.6 BTC. The 'Buy Bitcoin' sign, written on a yellow legal pad, symbolizes Bitcoin's emergence in the global financial landscape. This physical artifact is one of the few widely recognized symbols of Bitcoin, given its primarily digital nature. The auctioned notepad also includes Langalis’ original notes and sketches of the sign from that historic day. Langalis was reportedly a 22-year-old intern at the Cato Institute at the time of the famous incident. The funds raised from the auction will support Langalis’ new venture, Tirrel Corp, which aims to create a Bitcoin Lightning network wallet on Urbit. In 2019, Langalis created and sold 21 replicas of the iconic 'Buy Bitcoin' sign, which fetched an average price of 0.8 each, approximately $51,300 per piece today. These replicas are displayed in the offices of venture firms such as Paradigm, Blockchain Capital, Castle Island Ventures, and the crypto think-tank Coin Center. After Langalis held up the sign during a 2017 House Financial Services hearing, he was escorted out of the building for violating committee rules. However, the image of the sign quickly spread across the internet. Following the event, bitcoin’s price surged by 3.7% at the time of the broadcast. Since then, bitcoin’s value has skyrocketed, going from around $2,700 in July 2017 to a peak of over $73,000 last month. This increase has been in part due to significant regulatory decisions in the United States, including allowing the launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds earlier this year."

4/29/2024,Contrasting Predictions Emerge For Bitcoin's Bull Run Peak: $70K or a Whopping $210K?,"According to Cointelegraph: Bitcoin's Peak Cycle: A Debate Between $70K and $210K Predictions As Bitcoin ( ) continues its uncertain walk on the pricing spectrum, conflicting predictions over its cycle peak emerge, oscillating between $70,000 and a stunning $210,000.  1. The $70K Peak Theory : Pioneered by veteran trader Peter Brandt, the 'exponential decay pattern' theory implies each consecutive cycle peak reaching around 20% of the previous cycle's peak gain. Applied to this cycle, the theory projects a 4.5x gain from the low of roughly $15,500, placing the cycle peak near $70,000 - a milestone Bitcoin ( ) already touched in March 2024. However, Brandt gives a 25% chance that Bitcoin's cycle peak has already occurred. Bitcoin cycle exponential decay. Source: Peter Brandt 2. The $210K Peak Extrapolation : Contradicting Brandt's theory, Giovanni Santostasi, CEO, and director of research at Quantonomy, bases his prediction on long-term power law behavior. Pointing out the inadequacy of significant data for Brandt's theory, Santostasi calculates percentage deviation of peak prices from the long-term power law trend to predict a fourth cycle peak around December 2025, hitting approximately $210,000. The subsequent cycle's predicted bottom stands around $83,000. BTC power law predictions. Source: Giovanni Santostasi 3. Other Predictions : Predictions from fellow industry experts also lean towards a bullish scenario. Swyftx's lead analyst Pav Hundal envisions Bitcoin ( ) doubling by the next halving in 2028, estimating a price around $120,000. Laurent Benayoun, CEO of Acheron Trading, envisages a potential cycle peak nearing $180,000. As Bitcoin showcases a steady $62,528 at the time of writing, the speculations present  a captivating debate over whether the currency has already swept past its cycle peak or if a much greater milestone is yet to be achieved."
4/29/2024,Prominent Trader Peter Brandt's Bitcoin Predictions Stir Controversy,"According to U.Today, Peter Brandt, a well-known trader recognized for his in-depth cryptocurrency market analyses, has recently stirred both enthusiasm and debate with his latest predictions on Bitcoin's future path. Brandt's analysis has previously explored the concept of Exponential Decay, highlighting a worrying trend of declining momentum in Bitcoin's bull market cycles over time. His analysis identified four major bull cycles in Bitcoin's history, with the current surge being the fifth. He observed a pattern where each subsequent cycle has seen a reduced exponential advance, suggesting a significant loss of momentum from previous cycles. Brandt projected a potential peak of around $72,723 for the current cycle, a figure already achieved in recent trading, and suggested that Bitcoin may have already hit its peak. However, he added a twist to his analysis by assigning only a 25% probability to his projection, giving more credence to a report he issued in February. In this report, Brandt projected a bullish market until September-October 2025, with Bitcoin's price potentially skyrocketing to as high as $160,000. Brandt's dual predictions have caused a stir within the crypto community, with some investors eagerly adopting an optimistic outlook while others remain wary, considering the potential impact of Exponential Decay. As debates continue, the question of which scenario is more likely becomes increasingly pressing, challenging investors to evaluate the risks and rewards of their positions in an unpredictable cryptocurrency market."
4/29/2024,"Bitcoin Miners Earn Over 1,200 BTC from Runes Fees Following Halving","According to Cointelegraph: Bitcoin Miners Benefit from Rune Transactions Bitcoin miners have reaped significant rewards thanks to the Rune's implementation that has caused a surge in transaction fees. This unexpected turn has softened the anticipated impact of reduced block rewards that follow Bitcoin's halving event. Dune dashboard data shows that fees for minting Runes have surpassed 1,200 BTC. Source: Cryptokoryo Research Greg Beard, CEO of Stronghold Digital Mining, emphasized that while the halving led to an expected decrease in mining revenue due to reduced Bitcoin mining rewards, the introduction of Runes has offered a considerable respite. Beard unequivocally stated, ""what we lost in rewards, we made up for in transaction fees."" Marathon’s Chief Growth Officer, Adam Swick, is of a similar mindset. Swick pointed out the escalating fees following the halving, fueled by the launch of Runes and broader network activity. ""This has certainly helped to lessen the impact of halving, or perhaps delay the impact depending on how long the fees persist,"" he commented. Runes have considerably contributed to miners' earnings, generating over 1,200 BTC worth of transaction fees since the Bitcoin halving event. Runes, thanks to the creation of Inscriptions by Casey Rodarmor, have enabled users to create more efficient fungible tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain—leading to varied reactions from the Bitcoin community. However, for mining firms, the impact of Runes has been more than welcome, given that transaction fees provide a useful buffer against Bitcoin reward reductions. Beard, while speaking about the impact of Runes, indicated that emerging functionalities being built on Bitcoin might result in the trend leaning towards higher transaction fees in the future. According to both Beard and Swick, innovations like Ordinals and Runes that increase the usage and adoption of the Bitcoin blockchain have been a boon for miners and the Bitcoin ecosystem, particularly as the competition for diminishing block rewards intensifies. The rise in the utilization of Bitcoin's network, attracting more users and thus leading to potentially higher transaction fees, signifies a positive development. This not only diversifies Bitcoin's use but also underpins its growth, reflecting well for both miners and the overall ecosystem."
4/29/2024,"Bitcoin Predicted To Reach $150,000 By 2025 End, Says Analyst","According to BlockBeats, an analyst from Bernstein stated on Monday, April 29, that Bitcoin's trend would be a 'short-term pause' before it recovers the bull market and moves towards a target of $150,000 by the end of 2025. The analyst mentioned that Bitcoin would need time to become an acceptable investment portfolio recommendation, and platforms would also require time to establish a compliant framework for selling ETF products. The report reiterated the Bitcoin cycle target of $150,000 by the end of 2025. The reason for this prediction is the net inflow of spot Bitcoin ETF so far being $12 billion, and the healthy state of top Bitcoin miners' income after halving, under the condition of market integration and trading fees normalizing around 10%. The analyst believes that these factors will contribute to Bitcoin's rise and eventual achievement of the projected target."
4/29/2024,Bitcoin Experiences Fifth Consecutive Negative Weekly Close,"According to CryptoPotato, Bitcoin is potentially entering its fifth consecutive negative weekly close, a pattern historically associated with bear market conditions. The pattern was noted by Twitter user MisterCh0c, who faced criticism from more optimistic followers. They pointed out that the current drawdown, which has been ongoing throughout April, is mild compared to previous bull markets. Bitcoin closed at a weekly high of approximately $71,400 on March 31, and closed this Sunday at roughly $63,000, marking a 12% drop. Lead Glassnode analyst James Check supported this observation, stating that Bitcoin has only declined by a maximum of 20% from its high of $73,000 this cycle. In contrast, the 2017 bull market saw multiple drawdowns ranging from 20% to 30%. Despite these pullbacks being typical for a bull market, many are surprised that the selling pressure on Bitcoin has extended to the newly launched Bitcoin spot ETFs. These funds have absorbed over $12 billion of net inflows since January, but these flows have stagnated over the past month. Outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) have often exceeded inflows to all other Bitcoin ETFs combined. Macro investment analyst Jim Bianco suggests that the dominant buyers of Bitcoin ETFs are 'degen retail' investors. He argues this is a bearish sign, as these investors are likely to 'bail at the first signs of trouble', especially when the price falls below their cost basis of $58,000. However, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas counters this by noting that most investors have not yet reported their ETF holdings in 13F filings. He also points out that it can take time for advisors to get involved, as evidenced by BITO, the Bitcoin futures ETF, which has 40% of its investment holdings owned by advisors after 30 months on the market."

The Worst Month Since Last Bear Market : If Bitcoin ( ) does suffer a 12% loss this month, as data from CoinGlass indicates, this will be its worst-performing month since November 2022. Whichever direction it takes, the monthly closure will become a key new price consideration. BTC/USD monthly returns (screenshot). Source: CoinGlass 3. Bitcoin ETFs in Hong Kong: Bitcoin ( ) is likely to experience déjà vu this week as Hong Kong announces its plans to launch its own spot Bitcoin ( ) exchange-traded funds (ETFs), just four months following the United States. As per Willy Woo, creator of on-chain statistics platform Woobull, this could lead to significant demand for spot ETF products, considering Asia’s market user count exceeds that of the US and Europe combined. 4. Revisiting a Support Line : As Bitcoin ( ) hovers near significant support levels ($60,000 and $58,000), the aggregate cost basis of Bitcoin's short-term holders (entities holding a portion of for a maximum of 155 days) is gaining analysts' attention. Currently standing just under $59,800, this has repeatedly provided support during recovery from the bear market lows of 2022. 5. Retail Investors Returning: Despite Bitcoin’s lackluster price action, interest from smaller retail investors seems to be on the rise. Data shows a flip to positive rolling wallet balances on April 8 for the first time since mid-January, suggesting small-scale retail holders are starting to stack sats again. Despite having a challenging month, Bitcoin seems ready to take on the turbulence lying ahead, as broader developments in the crypto space, like the launch of Bitcoin ETFs in Hong Kong, keep adding to the market excitement."

Meanwhile, the market has its eyes set on the forthcoming spot-based Bitcoin ( ) and Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) set to debut in Hong Kong. Cryptocurrencies have retracted their weekend gains, with the broad-market CoinDesk Market Index experiencing a 3% decline in the last 24 hours. Scheduled for Tuesday morning, the first set of Hong Kong-listed spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs are about to commence trading. Despite the lackluster buzz among investors, a leader from one issuing firm anticipates the first-day issuance of the Hong Kong offerings to surpass the debut in the US earlier this year. Following a dip from the weekend high of $64,000 to a brief low of $61,800, Bitcoin ( ) recovered marginally to nearly $63,000 during US afternoon hours. Major altcoins, including Ether, Solana, and Dogecoin, also let go of their weekend returns, experiencing a 4%-6% fall. In recent weeks, the crypto markets have taken a sideways trajectory due to a lack of robust investment impulses, leading to a cooling-down from last month's Bitcoin ( ) price action and altcoin/memecoin frenzy.

4/29/2024,"Bitcoin Miner Successfully Solves Solo Block, Acquires Full Reward","According to CryptoPotato, a Bitcoin miner has successfully solved a network block independently, earning a full 3.125 reward. This event occurred at block 841,286, following the fourth Bitcoin halving on April 20 at block 840,000. The halving reduced the block reward from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC, currently valued at approximately $200,000. On April 29, Con Kolivas, a software engineer and administrator from the solo mining pool ckpool, announced that an individual miner, not a large company, had solved the 282nd solo block in Bitcoin’s history. This is a rare occurrence, with only 282 instances recorded out of approximately 841,300 blocks produced since Bitcoin’s inception 14 years ago. Kolivas noted that this miner had a significant hash rate of approximately 120PH (peta hashes) at the time, equivalent to around 0.12 EH (exa hashes), with an average of around 12PH over a week. This hash rate was roughly 0.02% of the total network hash rate. Kolivas speculated that this miner had either recently transitioned from pooled mining post-halving, likely due to no longer covering their electricity costs for pooled mining, or they may have been intermittently hashing or renting large amounts alone. The achievement is significant due to the rarity of mining a valid block solo, likened to winning the lottery. Mining Bitcoin involves participants contributing computational power to solve and add the next block to the network. However, with the increasing price of Bitcoin, mining has become more popular, leading to increased competitiveness, known as difficulty, and an increase in hash rate, or network horsepower. As a result, it has become nearly impossible to solve a block alone due to this high competition. In March 2023, a solo miner successfully secured the entire 6.25 reward for solving a block. However, Bitcoin prices were considerably lower during that time, resulting in the reward being valued at around $150,000. The most recent solo block was mined on April 5, just a couple of weeks before the halving. A solo miner successfully solved block 837,814 with a hash rate of 7PH. Notably, the reward was valued at approximately $422,750 at the time. According to Bitinfocharts, the average network hash rate currently stands at 618 EH/s (exa hashes per second), reaching an all-time high of 728 EH/s on April 23. This is an increase of more than 90% over the past 12 months, showing the exceptional nature of the latest solo mining achievement."
4/29/2024,MicroStrategy CEO Saylor's Stock Sales Reach $400 Million Amid Bitcoin Surge,"According to Bloomberg, MicroStrategy CEO, Saylor, has accumulated an estimated $400 million from pre-scheduled daily sales of approximately 5,000 shares of the enterprise software company from January to the previous week. These sales followed the exercising of options granted in 2014 that were due to expire. The company's stock has doubled this year to around $1,280, surpassing the record-setting gains of the original cryptocurrency during the same period. In 2014, MicroStrategy was trading at around $160. The superior performance of MicroStrategy's stock, based in Tysons Corner, Virginia, seems to be alleviating investor worries that Saylor, the controlling shareholder, might be selling at the peak. However, the premium that MicroStrategy is receiving over Bitcoin after the introduction of US exchange-traded funds that can hold the cryptocurrency in January is beginning to draw attention. Investors are anticipated to focus on MicroStrategy's first-quarter results, which will be announced after the close of regular stock trading on Monday. Revenue is projected to be steady at around $122 million, according to analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. A net loss of 61 cents per share is predicted. MicroStrategy had a net income of $461 million in the same quarter last year, boosted by a specific factor. The value of MicroStrategy's Bitcoin holdings has risen to approximately $14 billion since the company began buying the digital asset as part of its inflation hedging strategy. Investors are likely more interested in learning when MicroStrategy will adopt a different approach. Despite this, MicroStrategy continued to purchase more Bitcoin. In March, the company sold additional shares to fund its Bitcoin buying spree."
4/29/2024,MicroStrategy's Michael Saylor Spends Thousands of Hours Studying Bitcoin,"According to U.Today, Michael Saylor, the founder of MicroStrategy, a business intelligence giant, has revealed that he has spent thousands of hours studying Bitcoin. In a recent interview on the 'Visao de Lider' podcast, Saylor, a staunch Bitcoin advocate, discussed his views on the leading cryptocurrency. He was asked about the number of hours he has dedicated to studying Bitcoin, to which he responded that he has spent several thousand hours over the past three and a half years. Saylor's understanding and appreciation of Bitcoin have grown over time. Initially, after 20 hours of study, he was skeptical, comparing Bitcoin to online gambling and predicting it might eventually be banned. However, after dedicating over 100 hours to studying the digital asset, he began to see Bitcoin as superior to gold and a 'really good idea digital asset.' After reaching 1,000 hours of study, Saylor concluded that Bitcoin was 'probably the best digital asset.' His understanding deepened further after several thousand hours of study. He began to see Bitcoin as an 'instrument of economic empowerment' and a representation of property rights for eight billion people. He described it as the 'singularity where engineering and science and mathematics crash into economics and politics.' Saylor also noted that he has yet to meet a Bitcoin critic who has spent even 100 hours studying the cryptocurrency. In terms of market performance, Bitcoin has seen a decrease in value over the past few days. In the last 24 hours, it lost 2.45% of its market value, dropping to the $63,903 zone. Since April 24, the leading cryptocurrency has decreased by 6.85% overall. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at the $62,393 level."

This occurred despite Bitcoin's significant price rally during the same period, according to a press release issued on Monday afternoon. With expectations that MicroStrategy might adopt the new digital asset fair value accounting standard, thereby yielding a considerable profit due to Bitcoin's remarkable first quarter rally, the company opted to maintain its traditional accounting standard. As per these metrics, the firm valued its Bitcoin holdings at $23,680 per unit (totalling $5.1 billion) at the end of the quarter, as opposed to the March closing price of $71,028 per bitcoin ( ) (totalling $15.2 billion). MicroStrategy further revealed an April addition of 122 tokens to its Bitcoin holdings, which pushed its total accumulated assets to 214,400 bitcoins ( ). As of the current Bitcoin ( ) price of approximately $63,000, the company's holdings are estimated to be valued at about $13.5 billion. Andrew Kang, CFO of MicroStrategy, stated during the earnings call that early adoption of the new digital asset fair value accounting rule remains part of the company's future plan, with the best time for implementation currently under evaluation. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has made it mandatory for this new rule to be implemented by January 1, 2025, but allows early adoption. In the wake of these revelations, shares of MicroStrategy are observed to have dipped by 3.3% in after-hours trading."
4/29/2024,"Bitcoin Drops To Ten-Day Low, Analysts Predict Further Corrections","According to CryptoPotato, Bitcoin has experienced a significant drop, falling more than 15% from its mid-March peak to under $62,000 on Monday morning. Analysts from 'Stockmoney Lizards' have noted that despite the halving being over, Bitcoin continues to show a downward trend. They suggest that this is not the end of the bull market, but rather a correction that could potentially push prices back to the $50K range before continuing. They referred to this as a 'triple top' or 'Wyckoff distribution', indicating that Bitcoin is currently in correction mode. The analysts believe that a correction is necessary after half a year of solid gains. Factors such as war, recession fears, inflation, and reduced ETF buying are all contributing to the current market sentiment. They have identified several layers of support at $60K, $56K, and $52K, each one becoming more likely if the one above it is broken. The short-term outlook for May, which is historically a neutral month, is a potential uptrend within the correction range. However, they also warned that any bad news could push the prices towards the $50K range. This week, the Federal Reserve will make its interest rate decision. Given the higher than expected inflation outlook, rates are likely to remain where they are. This could potentially accelerate the market correction and drop Bitcoin below its immediate support level of $60K. Trader 'CrypNuevo' has advised caution for the coming week, stating that they will not be entering it with any open positions. Despite the overall short-term sentiment being gloomy, Glassnode analyst 'Checkmatey' has observed that Bitcoin retail holders, who are often quick to sell at the first sign of a correction, appear to be accumulating once again. According to Glassnode data, 'Shrimp' accounts with less than 1 are accumulating 12,200 coins per month. Corrections are considered healthy parts of market cycles and often present opportunities to buy the dip. However, the depth and duration of this current correction remain uncertain."
4/30/2024,"Bitcoin Bull Market May Have Peaked, Predicts Veteran Analyst Peter Brandt","According to BlockBeats, Peter Brandt, a seasoned chart analyst and founder of Factor Trading who successfully predicted the Bitcoin crash in 2018, has suggested that the Bitcoin bull market may have reached its peak. He anticipates that the cryptocurrency's price could drop by nearly 50%. Brandt believes there is a 25% chance that the bull market cycle has ended after Bitcoin hit a high of around $73,000 in March. He predicts that Bitcoin's price will fall back to the low of over $30,000 in 2021, a drop of about 50% from the current level. Brandt's argument is based on his concept of 'exponential decay', which suggests that each bull market cycle of Bitcoin from 2009 to 2021 has seen a decrease of about 20% compared to the previous cycle. Based on this, he calculates that the increase in this bull market is expected to be about 4.5 times that of the previous cycle (2018-2021), resulting in a predicted high point of $72,723. After Bitcoin broke through this milestone in March, it could mean the end of this bull market. However, Brandt believes that if Bitcoin loses momentum after a significant rise, it could be the most beneficial in the long run. He points out that gold has a similar trend, with gold hitting a low at the end of 2022 after a period of significant rise, and then rebounding sharply to a new high this year."
4/30/2024,Bitcoin Struggles To Break Out Of Current Price Range,"According to U.Today, Bitcoin is currently facing a significant challenge: breaking out of its current tight price range. On the daily chart, Bitcoin has been fluctuating between the $60,000 and $70,000 marks, struggling to find a definitive direction. The Relative Strength Index (RSI), which is around the 50% level, suggests a balance in market momentum. The main question on everyone's mind is whether Bitcoin can maintain its support above $60,000 or if it will succumb to bearish pressure, potentially leading to a drop towards $52,000. While such a drop is possible, analysts believe it to be a less likely scenario given the current market structure. On the other hand, a decisive climb above the $70,000 resistance level could set the stage for Bitcoin to reach new highs. However, this move is not without its challenges. With the Bollinger Bands tightening, a significant move may be imminent. Support levels are visible around $60,436, which could act as a potential springboard for a bounce back, while the $70,000 region remains the key resistance to overcome. A breakout on either side could determine the trend for the coming weeks. Currently, the market is in a neutral position, as the lack of volatility and liquidity will not allow Bitcoin to break through. This has led to speculation that the so-called 'crab market' might become a possible future for the market. Bitcoin's biggest price challenge at the moment is breaking out of its current range, with resistance set just above $70,000 and support around $60,000, the path Bitcoin will take is still unclear."

BTC/USD daily chart. Source: TradingView Trading data indicate that the ( ) price has fallen, from a peak of $64,727 on April 30, dropping 6.5% to an intraday low of $60,505. This fall corresponds with a lukewarm response to the recent spot Bitcoin ( ) and Ethereum ( ) ETFs launch in Hong Kong and the rising concern about stagflation in the U.S. Also, the sustained sluggish flow into U.S. Bitcoin ( ) ETFs intensifies the downward pressure on the BTC price. Analysts suggest a potential price drop as low as $42,000 Bitcoin's 2024 extraordinary surge in price, culminating in record highs before the halving event, has stimulated speculations on whether it has reached its peak.

4/30/2024,"Bitcoin Testnet Faces Griefing Attack, Generating Three Years’ Worth of Blocks in a Week","According to CryptoPotato, a griefing attack on the Bitcoin testnet recently led to a significant surge in network activity, generating over 165,000 blocks, equivalent to three years’ worth of blocks, in just one week. The attacker, Jameson Lopp, co-founder and Chief Security Officer of Casa, publicly acknowledged his role in the incident, which sparked criticism from other Bitcoin developers. Lopp defended the attack as a 'trivial exploit' that required only 20 lines of code and cost him just $1 in electricity. He argued that his intent was not malicious but to draw attention to a weakness he had previously identified and felt was not being adequately addressed through conventional communication methods. The attack involved flooding the testnet with excessive transactions, spamming the network, and significantly increasing the workload. This led to a spike in network difficulty and the generation of over 165,000 blocks. Data from mempool.space showed a significant increase in hash rate and difficulty, peaking at 2,315 TH/s on April 19, before returning to normal levels of around 86 TH/s by April 30. Lopp's description of the incident as a 'free stress test' prompted further backlash from the crypto community. He advocated for a reset of Bitcoin’s testnet to address the 'timewarp' vulnerability and restore mining rewards. However, some likened Lopp’s actions to vandalism. Francis Pouliot, for instance, compared it to defecating in a communal jacuzzi to prompt a relocation. He expressed frustration at the incident, stating that it interfered with the tests of open-source Bitcoin application builders and wasted their time. A member of the Bitcoin Talk Thread referred to the controversy as a 'testnet war' and suggested that individuals like Lopp should be banned from participating in Bitcoin’s testnet activities. He labeled Lopp as a potential threat to the overall security of the Bitcoin network."
4/30/2024,Morgan Stanley Seeks Bitcoin ETF Exposure for 12 Funds,"According to U.Today, Morgan Stanley, the American multinational investment bank, has submitted a filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to gain Bitcoin ETF exposure for 12 of its funds. The funds include Advantage, Asia Opportunity, Counterpoint Global, Developing Opportunity, Global Insight, Global Opportunity, Global Permanence, Growth, Inception, International Advantage, International Opportunity, and Permanence Portfolios. These funds may indirectly gain investment exposure to Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, by investing in Bitcoin ETFs. However, the amount of investments into Bitcoin ETF will be subject to 'certain limits.' The bank has stated that the risk associated with investing in spot Bitcoin ETFs is similar to the risk of investing directly in the underlying cryptocurrency. 'Investments in a Bitcoin ETF expose a Fund to all of the risks related to Bitcoin discussed above and also expose a Fund to risks specific to such Bitcoin ETF,' the filing states. Last week, AdvisorHub reported that Morgan Stanley might potentially allow thousands of its brokers to solicit purchases for Bitcoin ETFs, which are currently only allowed on an unsolicited basis. This could significantly boost the demand for Bitcoin ETFs. Despite the significant drop in Bitcoin ETF flows, Bernstein, a prominent brokerage firm, remains optimistic about the largest cryptocurrency. The firm maintains its highly optimistic $150,000 Bitcoin price target, which it expects to be achieved next year. Bernstein believes that the recent wave of Bitcoin ETF outflows is only a temporary pause and should not be overanalyzed by analysts."
4/30/2024,Bitcoin Miners Face Revenue Decline Following Latest Halving,"According to CryptoPotato, Bitcoin miners are experiencing the negative impacts of the recent halving, with industry revenues hitting their lowest since early 2023. This situation has led to tighter profit margins and raised concerns about the survival of certain industry firms during Bitcoin’s next halving epoch. It also brings into question the potential impact on Bitcoin’s market price. Data from on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant reveals a sharp drop in Bitcoin’s 'Puell Multiple' immediately after the halving between April 19 and April 20. The Puell Multiple is a ratio that compares the value of daily issuance in USD terms to the 365-day moving average of the same metric. With the number of new BTC issued to miners dropping from 6.25 BTC per block to 3.125 BTC per block, the Puell multiple has seen a decline. According to Glassnode Academy, a high Puell multiple indicates high miner profitability, incentivizing miners to liquidate their coins. On the other hand, a low multiple forces less competitive miners to shut down their rigs, making the remaining miners more profitable and enabling them to sell fewer coins to cover their operations. As of April 28, the multiple was at 0.73, significantly below its 365-day simple-moving-average of 1.43. CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju stated on Twitter that miners now have two options: capitulation or waiting for a rise in Bitcoin price. He added that there are currently no signs of capitulation. CryptoQuant’s mining dashboard indicates that miner BTC flows to OTC desks and exchanges remain relatively low, suggesting that they are not eager to sell their BTC. Despite the suppressed miner revenues, the day of the halving was unusually profitable for miners, generating $106 million in revenue compared to approximately $68 million on previous days. This temporary profit boost was largely due to the simultaneous launch of Runes, a new protocol standard for minting tokens on Bitcoin, developed by Ordinals creator Casey Rordamor. The rush to mint new tokens by Runes users drove Bitcoin network fees to over $100 per transaction, allowing miners to net several blocks with over 30 in fee revenue. However, fees have since returned to normal levels, and miner revenue has dropped to $28.5 million per day."

4/30/2024,MicroStrategy Records Digital Asset Impairment Loss Amid New Accounting Rules,"According to Bloomberg, MicroStrategy, the enterprise-software maker led by Bitcoin advocate, is unable to recognize any increases in its Bitcoin holdings under current accounting rules. This includes the nearly 67% surge in the recent quarter. However, a recently passed accounting rule that mandates the valuation of the digital asset at market prices is set to change this. Companies have until 2025 to implement this revision. MicroStrategy did not adopt the revision for the first quarter, instead, it recorded a $191.6 million digital-asset impairment loss. The Tysons Corner, Virginia-based company had a net income of $461.2 million, or $38.97 a share a year earlier, after registering a tax benefit. In 2020, MicroStrategy became the first public company to buy Bitcoin as a capital allocation strategy, with the company's leader citing the need to hedge against inflation. Despite the admiration of digital-asset proponents, no other US public company besides Tesla Inc. and a few crypto-related firms have decided to hold the volatile cryptocurrency on its balance sheet. MicroStrategy's Bitcoin cache has increased by 25,250 since the end of the fourth quarter. As of April 26, the company is holding 214,400 Bitcoin. MicroStrategy's shares fell about 7% in after-hours trading. The stock had more than doubled this year. The company's leader sold an estimated $400 million worth of stock during the first quarter, according to Bloomberg estimates.

4/30/2024,MicroStrategy Expands Bitcoin Portfolio Despite Revenue Decline,"According to CryptoPotato, MicroStrategy, a business intelligence company, has continued to expand its Bitcoin holdings, recently purchasing an additional 122 for approximately $8 million. This brings the company's total Bitcoin holdings to 214,400. Despite a recent decline in Bitcoin's value, the NASDAQ-listed company remains committed to its Bitcoin investment strategy. In 2024 alone, MicroStrategy has acquired over 25,000 BTC. The company's recent acquisition in April was made at a time when Bitcoin's value was experiencing a dip. Bitcoin reached a record high of over $73,000 in March 2024 but has since declined by more than 13%, currently trading at around $63,400. MicroStrategy's total Bitcoin holdings, valued at approximately $13.6 billion, were purchased for $7.5 billion, at an average price of $35,164 per coin. This includes a total of 25,250 bought since the end of Q4 2023 for $1.65 billion, or at an average cost of $65,232 per coin, largely funded by two successful convertible debt offerings. However, the company's Q1 2024 financial results revealed a 5.5% decrease in revenue, down to $115.2 million compared to the same period in 2023. The report also noted a net loss of $53.1 million in Q1 2024, or $3.01 per share, compared to a net income of $461.2 million in the same quarter in 2023. This net loss was largely due to a digital asset impairment loss of $191.6 million in the first quarter of 2024.

4/30/2024,Bitcoin Leads Digital Asset Investment Products in Outflows,"According to U.Today, Bitcoin ( ) is leading the outflows among digital asset investment products for the third consecutive week. The digital asset ecosystem, including spot crypto ETFs, has witnessed outflows amounting to $435 million in the past week. This is the highest volume of outflows the industry has seen since March, indicating a decline in the enthusiasm of ETF investors that was prevalent during the initial approval of spot Bitcoin ETF. A significant portion of this outflow, $388 million, originates from the United States, despite its year-to-date inflows still standing at a record $13.6 billion. Exchange-traded products (ETPs) are bearing the impact of this bearish sentiment, with a substantial drop in trading volume. Specifically, ETP trading volume decreased from $18 billion to $11.8 billion within a week. Spot Bitcoin ETFs like BlackRock's IBIT have long maintained a streak of inflows, but this was abruptly interrupted after 71 days last week by outflows, indicating a significant drop in demand. Other products, including Grayscale’s GBTC, also experienced outflows. Over the past week, Bitcoin's price fell significantly, dropping to as low as $64,000 and further declining by 6% to its current trading price of $62,461.12. This has raised doubts among short-term investors. Grayscale spot Bitcoin ETF is leading the outflows, recording its lowest outflow in nine weeks at $440 million. Despite the apparent drop in demand, new Bitcoin issuers have driven inflows to the niche. Around two weeks ago, inflows peaked at $256 million but fell to $226 million last week. The numerous outflows from these Bitcoin-linked products have resulted in a drop in altcoins. Ethereum ( ) is also experiencing an increase in outflows, while other altcoins like Solana ( ), Litecoin ( ) and Chainlink (LINK), continue to see inflows of $4 million, $3 million and $2.8 million, respectively."

4/30/2024,Runes Transactions Generate $117 Million in Bitcoin Network Fees Post-Halving,"According to CryptoPotato, Runes transactions have generated $117 million in cumulative Bitcoin network fee revenue post-halving, with $62.4 million amassed on the day of the halving itself. However, recent data reveals a significant drop, with Runes transactions contributing only $1.03 million in fees on April 28. On the day of the halving, April 20, transaction fees within the Bitcoin network saw a notable spike, primarily due to the implementation of the Runes protocol, which led to higher mining fees. Runes transactions accounted for 57.7% of all Bitcoin network transactions, with financial transactions trailing behind at 41.5%. Ordinals and BRC-20 accounted for 0.5% and 0.2%, respectively. This dominance persisted over the halving weekend, with Runes maintaining most of the network activity. On April 21, Runes transactions accounted for 51.6% of total transactions. However, by April 22, this dominance began to decrease, dropping to 42.5%, while Bitcoin financial transactions claimed a larger portion, accounting for 56.5% of total transactions processed that day. The situation has since changed, with transaction fees decreasing. Medium-priority transactions are now priced at approximately $8.48, while high-priority transactions are priced at around $9.321. This marks a 75% decrease in fees compared to the immediate aftermath of the halving, which saw fees rise to $146 for a medium-priority transaction and $170 for a high-priority transaction. Bitcoin researcher Jade Ardinals suggests that the increased load on the network was primarily caused by minting. Speculation surrounding Runes caused a surge in minting activities, creating an 'artificial' strain on Bitcoin block space. Analysts anticipate that this pressure will diminish over time. However, they maintain that Runes will continue to attract more developers to Bitcoin. Runes tokens have already captured a large portion of Bitcoin’s on-chain activity. On April 25, Runes tokens comprised 45% of all Bitcoin transactions. Bitcoin Runes was developed by Casey Rodarmor to enhance the BRC-20 standard, known for its costly token creation and management on the blockchain due to its UTXO proliferation. Bitcoin faces challenges with accumulating unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs), which strain the network and lead to performance issues. Runes enables users to conduct more efficient transactions and create better-optimized tokens on Bitcoin by leveraging its UTXO format."

Despite this, Allemann remains optimistic about the future of the leading cryptocurrency, believing it will continue to attract buyers and reinforce the current uptrend. Even after a significant correction over the weekend, Allemann sees potential signs of recovery.

At the time of the report, Bitcoin was trading at $60,860 on major spot exchanges. The 100eyes Crypto Scanner account confirmed that the cryptocurrency has now approved its critical horizontal support. The recent drop in Bitcoin's price followed the launch of Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in Hong Kong, which turned out to be a somewhat underwhelming event, attracting only $12 million worth of trading volume. However, ETF analyst Eric Balchunas stated that the launch was not a complete failure, as it attracted $141 million worth of inflows. He pointed out that these numbers need to be adjusted for the size of Hong Kong's relatively small ETF market.

The firm, known as one of the earliest corporate adopters of the digital asset, has become a focal point in the cryptocurrency community. As per data from on-chain analytics website lookonchain, MicroStrategy added another 122 worth $7.8 million at $63,934 in April. This purchase has increased the firm's Bitcoin holdings by 25,250 since the end of the fourth quarter. The latest acquisition brings MicroStrategy's total Bitcoin holdings to 214,400 BTC, valued at $13.22 billion. The average purchase price was $35,180. Based on current Bitcoin prices, the profit is projected to be around $5.68 billion, as per lookonchain's estimates. However, due to existing accounting rules, MicroStrategy cannot report any increases in its Bitcoin holdings, including the nearly 67% increase in the most recent quarter. This could change with a new accounting rule that requires digital assets to be valued at market prices. Companies have until 2025 to adopt this revision. In 2020, MicroStrategy became the first public company to buy Bitcoin as a capital allocation strategy, citing the need to hedge against inflation. Despite Saylor's popularity among digital asset advocates, no other U.S. public company, except Tesla and a few crypto-related firms, has chosen to include Bitcoin in its financial statement. At the time of writing, had fallen 1.37% in the previous 24 hours to $61,536. Crypto analyst Ali suggested that a sustained close below the BTC short-term holder realized price, currently at $59,800, could indicate a potential BTC market peak. If the market peak is confirmed, BTC could drop to $51,530, or even $42,700. However, if Bitcoin can surpass $66,250 and maintain this support level, the bearish outlook would be invalidated.

5/1/2024,Key Crypto Events in May Could Impact Bitcoin and Broader Market,"According to U.Today, the month of May is expected to bring several significant events that could influence Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market. Among the anticipated events are the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision, the release of the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) for April, the Hong Kong Bitcoin Asia Conference, and the US Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) final decision on the Ethereum ( ) Spot Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). The Federal Reserve is widely expected to maintain the current interest rates during its meeting on May 1. Market participants will be keenly observing any hints from Fed Chair Jerome Powell regarding the conditions necessary for a potential rate reduction. This meeting, which will include a press conference by Powell, follows recent economic data showing a decrease in consumer confidence and ongoing wage pressures. Despite these factors and the expectation of a strong jobs report, it is unlikely that Powell will reconsider the current stance. Another key event in May is the anticipated release of the April CPI by the U.S. on May 15. The crypto community is also eagerly awaiting the SEC's potential approval of Spot Ethereum ETFs. A positive decision could stimulate buying pressure in the market. The SEC is expected to respond to VanEck's spot ETF application on May 23, and the Bitcoin ( ) spot option ETF application on May 29. Bitcoin's performance in April was its worst monthly showing since late 2022, with the cryptocurrency falling about 9%. This drop extended Bitcoin's losses into a second day, with the cryptocurrency reaching an intraday low of $56,500 from highs of $64,727. The possibility of prolonged higher interest rates appears to be affecting cryptocurrencies, as evidenced by Bitcoin's deeper losses. Bitcoin's price is now 22% lower than its March high of $73,803, suggesting a bear market."
5/1/2024,Bitcoin's Future Uncertain As It Dips Below Key Support Level,"According to U.Today, Peter Schiff, a well-known gold advocate, has once again expressed his pessimistic view on Bitcoin, emphasizing that the cryptocurrency is at a critical juncture. Schiff recently drew attention to Bitcoin's status, suggesting that its fall into what he refers to as the 'danger zone' could be a significant turning point. Bitcoin has indeed breached the $60,000 mark, a level that had served as a robust psychological and technical support during the 2024 bull run. This decline has further intensified negative market sentiment. Schiff believes that dropping below this crucial level could signal the end of the bullish run that has enthralled the market over the past year. Current charts show Bitcoin hovering around $58,540, with the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) nearby. Schiff cautions that a prolonged fall below this moving average would confirm the bearish trend, effectively 'ending the rally' and possibly terminating the bull run for the foreseeable future. Furthermore, an increase in trading volume accompanying the price drop indicates increased selling pressure. This surge in volume is typically a bearish indicator, further supporting Schiff's theory that the market is turning. The sentiment among traders is becoming increasingly cautious, with many preparing for further declines. From a technical perspective, if Bitcoin fails to reclaim the $60,000 level, the next major support is at $51,965. This represents a significant pullback from recent highs, and a drop to this level could trigger further selling. On the other hand, a rebound from current levels must overcome resistance at $60,000 to invalidate the bearish scenario. A successful push above this could see Bitcoin attempting to reach higher resistance levels near $64,000, offering a ray of hope for bulls."

5/1/2024,Bitcoin (BTC) Nearing Bottom? – 3 Indicative Signs Emerge,"According to Cointelegraph: Bitcoin ( ) Price Correction: Three Signs Point Towards a Possible Bottom A combination of the Federal Reserve’s recent minutes release, indications of Bitcoin ( ) miners’ resilience, and a rising demand for stablecoins in China implies that Bitcoin ( ) may be nearing its price floor. Bitcoin ( ) experienced a significant price drop between April 30 and May 1, falling by 11.5 % to $56,522. This caused $172 million of leveraged long position liquidations, which stands out as relatively low given the $28.9 billion open interest in Bitcoin ( ) futures immediately before the price crash. Market uncertainty is expected to settle following the publication of the Federal Reserve's minutes. Economists and investors are holding their breath as Jerome Powell, the chairperson of the US Federal Reserve, navigates the two-day monetary council meeting. Notwithstanding the expectation that interest rates will remain steady at 5.25%, questions remain about the ability of the U.S. Treasury Department's capacity to finance government expenses. Decreasing value in the Russell 2000 Index coupled with a downturn in WTI oil prices also signifies growing risk-aversion among investors. However, the general outlook for Bitcoin has become more optimistic following robust Q1 corporate earnings. Despite the recent halving of Bitcoin miners' rewards, there's negligible evidence of miner capitulation. This threw into focus the resilience of Bitcoin miners, staying at bay from selling despite a significant drop in the Hashrate Index. An increase in the demand for stablecoins in China, particularly USD Coin (USDC), is another signal for an improving market sentiment. The rising premium for USDC transactions in China exemplifies a robust demand for converting the Chinese yuan into USDC. However, as always, there remains some degree of uncertainty. In the US, for instance, net outflows from US-listed spot exchange-traded funds amounted to $635 million over the past five trading days. All eyes are now turned towards the support level at $56,500, which represents a crucial test for the market's trajectory."

5/1/2024,Bitcoin ETFs Show Signs of Stress Amid Cryptocurrency's Decline,"According to Bloomberg, signs of stress are becoming evident across spot-Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) as the cryptocurrency's value declines. Some of the largest ETFs tracking Bitcoin experienced the most significant discounts to the value of underlying assets in their brief history on Tuesday, following a roughly 5% slump in Bitcoin. The downward trend continued on Wednesday, with Bitcoin dropping as much as 5.6%. The $16 billion iShares Bitcoin Trust, among others, has been affected by this trend. These discounts may indicate the inherent frictions in overlapping the traditional market with Bitcoin. This is because shares in the funds can only be created and redeemed in exchange for cash rather than 'in-kind' exchanges for Bitcoin itself. However, such price deviations are usually short-lived due to the creation-redemption mechanism of ETFs. Despite this, the discounts highlight how Bitcoin's volatility may pose larger risks to ETF investors than funds focused on traditional financial assets. Concurrently, the volatility creates profitable opportunities for specialized trading firms known as authorized participants, who are responsible for keeping the fund prices in line with their net asset values. Expectations for fund flows were surpassed after the ETFs were launched, breaking multiple records in the more-than $8 trillion US industry. There are high hopes that more institutions will adopt spot-Bitcoin ETFs as they establish a track record. However, Bitcoin's price has historically been influenced by the macro-economic environment. A case is being made for the Federal Reserve to signal a delay in rate cuts after officials conclude a policy meeting Wednesday, which could be a challenging backdrop for speculative assets like digital tokens."
5/1/2024,Bitcoin Fear And Greed Index Indicates Neutral Investor Sentiment,"According to CryptoPotato, the Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index indicates that the sentiment of cryptocurrency investors has become neutral following Bitcoin's ( ) drop below $57,000. Data from Alternative.me reveals that the index is at 54, a level not seen in three months, suggesting that investors are neither fearful nor greedy in the current market conditions. The last time a neutral sentiment was observed among investors was on January 28, 2024, when BTC was priced around $42,000. During that period, the cryptocurrency was on an upward trend, and the market was abuzz with the launch of several spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds approved by U.S. authorities two weeks earlier. However, the current market sentiment differs significantly. Bitcoin has fallen from its all-time high of $73,700 in mid-March, and after a period of increased volatility, the cryptocurrency's value took a downturn. The Fear and Greed Index gauges market sentiment by analyzing various factors such as Bitcoin's dominance, social media activity, market momentum, trends, and volatility. The index ranges from 0 to 100, with 0 indicating extreme fear, 50 signaling neutrality, and 100 representing extreme greed. In recent weeks, investor sentiment has generally been greedy, occasionally reaching levels of extreme greed. The index was at 67 yesterday and 72 last week, suggesting that investors have been predominantly greedy. The index even spiked to 79 last month, indicating extreme greed.

The CEO stated that the company believes in the need for an open protocol for money, one that is not owned or controlled by any single entity. They see Bitcoin as the best and only candidate to be that protocol, and to ultimately become the native currency of the internet.

Typically, such options are approved a few days after the issuance of the spot ETFs. The move by the legislators is seen as a significant step towards the mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The approval of Bitcoin spot ETF options by the SEC would provide investors with a new way to gain exposure to Bitcoin without the need to hold the underlying asset. This could potentially increase the liquidity of Bitcoin and make it more accessible to a wider range of investors. However, the SEC has been cautious about approving Bitcoin ETFs due to concerns about market manipulation and lack of regulation. Despite this, the push by US lawmakers could potentially sway the SEC's decision in favor of approving Bitcoin spot ETF options. This development comes at a time when Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are gaining increased attention from institutional investors and traditional financial institutions.

5/2/2024,"Bitcoin Drops Below $60,000, XRP and Cardano Face Challenges","According to U.Today, Bitcoin has slipped below the significant $60,000 mark, causing concern among investors and market analysts. This drop could indicate the end of the current bull run, as the 100-day Exponential Moving Average is on the brink of falling. If this level breaks, it could mark the end of the bullish trend that has pushed Bitcoin to recent highs. This would not just be a setback, but a fundamental shift in market sentiment. The increase in trading volume, indicating a rise in selling pressure, further fuels these concerns. More traders are moving to offload their holdings, either in anticipation of lower prices or to cut their losses, adding to the downward pressure on Bitcoin. Bitcoin's immediate support is around the $50,000 mark, represented by the 200-day moving average. If this level holds, it could provide temporary relief or a base for potential recovery. However, if this support breaks, the next key level would be around $48,000. While the cryptocurrency market has seen significant declines across various assets, has shown relative resilience. Despite losing about 12% of its value in recent days, this drop is modest compared to other cryptocurrencies. XRP has managed to hold above the critical support level at $0.49, which is significant as it helps prevent further bearish momentum. XRP's current price hovers around $0.49, barely clinging to this essential support level. The resistance to watch is near the $0.56 mark. Cardano, on the other hand, has experienced a significant setback, losing a crucial support level at $0.44. Currently trading around the $0.42 level, 's situation has escalated concerns as this price point is considered far from optimal for sustaining the asset's valuation. The breakdown below $0.44 has not only weakened the technical outlook for ADA but has also instilled bearish sentiment across its trading landscape. This loss of support has opened up the potential for further declines, with the next critical support level now at $0.40. If ADA fails to hold this level, it could trigger a further slide toward the $0.38 mark."

5/2/2024,Meme Coins and Bitcoin ETF Hype Drive Current Crypto Market Cycle,"According to CryptoPotato, the current crypto market cycle, experiencing a significant pullback, is primarily driven by the popularity of coins and the excitement surrounding Bitcoin ETFs. Economist and trader Alex Krüger noted that meme coins have dominated the narrative, along with Bitcoin following the ETF launches. Despite many of these coins dumping or going to zero, and scams being prevalent on the Solana and Base networks, large-cap meme coins remain among the strongest performers of the year. They continue to show significant returns despite the market correction, establishing themselves as a viable asset class. CoinGecko data reveals that the total market capitalization of all meme coins is approximately $46 billion, surpassing the combined value of Ripple ( ) and Cardano ( ).

5/2/2024,Renowned Trader Predicts Bitcoin's Potential Dip Before Next Rally,"According to U.Today, Peter Brandt, a legendary trader known for his financial market insights, has suggested a possible dip for Bitcoin before its next surge. Following Bitcoin's recent 9% price drop, Brandt's analysis indicates a scenario where the leading cryptocurrency could dip into the high $40,000s before resuming its bullish trajectory. This assessment comes amidst increasing uncertainty after Bitcoin's significant loss since the start of the week, marking its largest drop of the year. Prices have plummeted from $64,700 to $57,400, causing market participants to be gripped by panic and doubt about the future of Bitcoin and the broader crypto market. Throughout his extensive career, Brandt has observed numerous market cycles. He points out a key observation: despite past halving events and the launch of ETFs, Bitcoin has failed to surpass its highs from three years ago. This insight emphasizes the need to resolve current market dynamics, especially as Bitcoin struggles to maintain its upward momentum. Despite acknowledging a 25% probability that Bitcoin had already reached its local peak at $74,000, Brandt remains cautiously optimistic about the ongoing bull market. However, he suggests that corrections may accompany this upward trend, with the potential for the Bitcoin price to correct by more than 25% from current levels. Notably, Bitcoin has not revisited the $40,000 mark in the past three months, highlighting the significance of Brandt's proposed pit stop. This prediction could be a crucial factor for investors and traders in the crypto market, as they navigate the volatile landscape of cryptocurrency prices."

5/3/2024,Whale Activity Increases as Bitcoin and Toncoin Reach New Highs,"According to U.Today, there has been a significant increase in whale activity over the past six months. The original cryptocurrency, Dogecoin ( ), has outperformed , ADA, and several other major altcoins. While it has come close to beating Bitcoin and Ethereum, it hasn't quite managed to do so. Bitcoin and Toncoin have reached new highs. A recent tweet revealed that Bitcoin, the world's largest and primary cryptocurrency, has set a new record for nonempty addresses, reaching 53.85 million wallets in the past six months. Toncoin (TON) wallets have surged to a high of 16,800. However, this network has been growing at a much faster pace than Bitcoin. The report by Santiment continues, showing that in terms of percentage growth, TON is at the top of the list with a massive 110% increase, leading to a total of 16,800 nonzero wallets in the past half year. Dogecoin follows this crypto with 27% growth and the 6.6 million wallet milestone achieved by now. Bitcoin and Ethereum have printed modest increases of 10% and 11%, respectively, but their number of wallets has spiked to 53.9 million and 120.7 million. and are at the bottom of the list, below Bitcoin. XRP nonempty wallets have increased by 7% (5.2 million in total), and ADA’s growth constituted 0%. The Cardano chain remains at the 4.5 million nonzero wallet level. Cryptocurrency analyst and trader Ali Martinez, who has recently gained popularity on the X platform, shared his prediction that is set to stage a bull run. Martinez explained that the correction Dogecoin is currently undergoing is normal for this coin and has been observed before DOGE broke into a bull run in the past. He referred to 2017, when DOGE broke out of a descending triangle pattern. In that year, the meme coin dumped 40% before it started on a massive 982% bull run. A similar scenario played out in 2021; a retracement by 56% occurred before a 12,197% surge and the all-time high. Currently, Dogecoin has again broken out of a similar pattern and is expected to ignite a bull run."
5/3/2024,Bitcoin ETFs Witness Over $500 Million Loss Amid Market Panic,"According to U.Today, the Bitcoin ( ) price has seen a significant drop, leading to panic in the spot Bitcoin ETFs segment. Analysts are questioning the rationality of this panic-selling. Qiao Wang, a seasoned cryptocurrency investor and cofounder of Messari, has referred to the May 1 session as the 'worst day by far' for exchange-traded funds based on spot Bitcoin (BTC). During this session, the net volume of funds in BTC ETFs lost $500 million. Fidelity Investments’ Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) accounted for the largest part of this loss, being down by $191 million. Meanwhile, products from Grayscale and combined cover over 50% of the half-billion losses. Wang agreed with his colleague Jim Bianco's observation of a large percentage of 'paper hands' among the first generation of Bitcoin spot ETF holders. The Bitcoin ETFs segment also experienced three difficult trading days on April 24, 25, and 30, with the May 1 session marking the sixth consecutive 'red' day for Bitcoin ETFs. Previously, spot Bitcoin ETFs were launched in Hong Kong, ending their first day of trading with a mediocre AUM of $140 million and a trading volume of $12.1 million in equivalent. Despite the current market conditions, Wang remains moderately optimistic about the future generations of Bitcoin Spot ETFs purchasers. He believes that more 'diamond hand' institutions will enter the scene, stating that heavyweight asset managers just 'need time to get comfortable'. Following the Bitcoin ( ) price drop below $57,000, almost $600 million in liquidated long positions were registered over the last two days, according to CoinGlass data."

5/3/2024,Elon Musk's Number Sequence Coincidentally Matches Bitcoin Price Movements,"According to U.Today, a sequence of numbers tweeted by Elon Musk in June 2021 has been interpreted by some as potential Bitcoin price predictions. Bitcoin Archive, a notable user on the X platform, suggested that Musk's sequence of numbers accurately predicted three Bitcoin price movements. The sequence was tweeted in response to a comment by Dogecoin developer Michi Lumin, who suggested that tweeting vague and cryptic messages could lead to them being interpreted as meaningful and mysterious. The sequence of numbers tweeted by Musk has been scrutinized by crypto enthusiasts, with some suggesting that they could represent future Bitcoin prices. For instance, Benjamin Cowen, a prominent crypto trader, humorously asked if Musk's sequence represented his Bitcoin price predictions. Bitcoin Archive claimed that Musk's sequence coincided with three accurate Bitcoin price movements. The sequence of numbers tweeted by Musk was examined to see if they matched any Bitcoin prices reached after his tweet. For example, Bitcoin reached $61,000 in March 2021, surged to $69,000 in November 2021, and dropped slightly below $20,000 in July 2022. In March 2024, Bitcoin soared to a historic peak close to $74,000 and then fell back close to $65,000 in late April of the same year. Some of the numbers in Musk's sequence appear to coincide with these Bitcoin price movements. However, it is important to note that these correlations are likely coincidental. While Musk is known for his business acumen, it is unlikely that he can accurately predict Bitcoin prices. The similarities between Musk's number sequence and Bitcoin's price movements are most likely a curious coincidence rather than a result of intentional prediction."

5/3/2024,Bitcoin's On-Chain Metrics Indicate Potential Strong Recovery,"According to U.Today, a detailed analysis of on-chain metrics suggests a possible robust recovery for Bitcoin, following its fall below $60,000. The 'Bitcoin Fundamental Index' by Swissblock, a combined measure of various Bitcoin network health indicators, recently reached what seems to be a turning point, indicating a potential rise in Bitcoin's price. A key metric to note is the Short-Term Holder MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value), which is currently at 0.96. This ratio essentially compares the market value (the current trading price of Bitcoin) to the realized value (the average price at which coins were last moved). A value below one usually indicates that short-term holders are holding coins at a loss, which can signal a potential bottom if other conditions align. Historically, when the STH-MVRV has fallen below one, it has often been a precursor to a market recovery. This suggests that the selling pressure from short-term holders is decreasing and could indicate that sellers are exhausted. This exhaustion is further supported by the recent performance of the Bitcoin Fundamental Index, which shows a recovery from lower levels, indicating increased network growth and investor confidence. The 'Bitcoin Fundamental Index' chart shows significant spikes in the index correlating closely with increases in Bitcoin's price. The index measures several aspects of network health, including transaction volume, wallet activity and other undisclosed proprietary indicators that aim to gauge the overall sentiment and fundamental strength of Bitcoin. The current index value is nearing the higher end of its recent range. Historically, such patterns have indicated strong bullish sentiment building up, especially when combined with a low STH-MVRV."

5/3/2024,Institutional Interest in Bitcoin ETFs Revealed Through 13F Filings,"According to Blockworks, 13F filings, which are a measure of institutional interest in Bitcoin ETFs, have been steadily coming in since the start of last month and are expected to continue until mid-May. These forms are mandatory filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that disclose the quarterly holdings of institutions managing $100 million or more. BNP Paribas and BNY Mellon are among the largest institutions to disclose holdings in a Bitcoin ETF. BNY Mellon's 13F reveals that it owns nearly 20,000 shares of IBIT and approximately 7,000 shares of Grayscale's Bitcoin ETF GBTC. BNP Paribas, however, owns only about 1,000 shares of IBIT. Smaller firms with larger holdings have also been identified. For instance, Pittsburgh-based registered investment manager Quattro Advisors owns 468,200 shares of BlackRock's ETF, according to their 13F. Legacy Wealth Management disclosed ownership of over 350,000 shares of Fidelity's ETF. One of the largest IBIT holders is Yong Rong, which disclosed in its 13F that it holds over a million shares of BlackRock's fund, making BlackRock one of the largest holdings in the manager's portfolio. Bloomberg's Eric Balchunas noted that Yong Rong is not the only Hong Kong asset manager investing in Bitcoin ETFs. Ovata also holds multiple Bitcoin ETFs, including those from Fidelity, Grayscale, and Bitwise, alongside IBIT. These companies join a list of firms that have previously disclosed their holdings, including Brookstone Capital Management, which owns both Fidelity and Bitwise's ETFs, and LexAurum, another IBIT holder. As previously reported by Blockworks, some analysts believe that this is just the beginning and not to expect too much from this first quarter of 13Fs. However, as the filings continue to be monitored, the interest may increase. Some of the larger institutions tend to file closer to the deadline."
5/3/2024,Bitcoin ETFs Decrease Holdings Amid Market Volatility,"According to U.Today, nine Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) have significantly reduced their holdings by a total of 8,107 , equivalent to approximately $478.22 million. Prominent entities such as BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale have reduced their holdings by 638 BTC ($37.62 million), 3,323 BTC ($196 million), and 1,588 BTC ($93.66 million), respectively. This substantial decrease in Bitcoin holdings by ETFs coincides with the cryptocurrency's price drop below the $60,000 mark, a critical support level that had previously been considered a strong threshold that held the market together. This price decline has led to significant outflows, indicating a shift in investor sentiment toward caution due to increased market volatility and potential risk aversion. Bitcoin has struggled to maintain levels above $60,000 and faced resistance near $61,018. After the drop, the price found temporary footing around $52,107, suggesting a possible new lower boundary of support. Currently, Bitcoin is trading slightly above $59,375, trying to recover from recent falls but still below the critical resistance level. For Bitcoin's price to exhibit growth and regain confidence among investors, it would need to consistently hold above the $52,107 support level and ideally break through the resistance at $61,018. This movement would likely require positive sentiment across the market, possibly driven by rising demand for risky assets. Looking ahead, the key for Bitcoin will be its ability to stabilize and attract investors back to a bullish stance. If it successfully maintains above the mentioned support and breaks past the resistance, it could signal a turnaround to a bullish market. However, failure to do so might see the price testing even lower support levels, possibly around $50,000."

The previous line that marked a shift to a bearish outlook was set at $68,300."
5/3/2024,BTC ETFs Expected To See Net Outflow Of Approximately 579 BTC,"According to PANews, on-chain data analyst Yu Jing predicts a net outflow of approximately 579 from ETF custodial addresses after the opening of the US stock market tonight. The outflow is expected to be primarily from Grayscale (GBTC), which is projected to see an outflow of about 926 BTC. On the other hand, four ETFs, including Ark Invest (ARKB), are expected to see an inflow of approximately 347 BTC. Currently, eleven BTC spot ETFs collectively hold 818,991 BTC, equivalent to about 48.59 billion USD. The prediction of a net outflow from ETF custodial addresses indicates a potential shift in the market dynamics. However, the overall holdings of these ETFs remain substantial, reflecting the continued interest and investment in BTC. The prediction by Yu Jing provides an insight into the potential market movements and the dynamics of the market. It is important to note that these predictions are based on current market conditions and can be subject to changes. Investors are advised to keep a close watch on the market trends and make informed decisions."

5/3/2024,JPMorgan Maintains Cautious Stance On Cryptocurrencies Amid Market Challenges,"According to U.Today, US banking giant JPMorgan has continued to express caution towards cryptocurrencies, as per their latest report released on April 23. The report suggests that the cryptocurrency market is currently facing a dearth of bullish catalysts, following a significant reduction in ETF inflows. The bank's analysts have identified high positioning, disappointing venture capital funding, and current production costs as the primary bearish catalysts contributing to the ongoing selling pressure. In the previous month, JPMorgan had suggested that the Bitcoin halving was already factored into the price, thus dampening some optimistic predictions. In February, the bank had predicted that the price of Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, could plummet to as low as $42,000 following the halving event. It was also forecasted that the production cost of a single coin could approximately double. During the same period, Bitcoin bull Mike Novogratz had also cautioned that the Bitcoin market was becoming overheated. Bitcoin's price had soared to an all-time high of $73,737 in March, recording eight consecutive months of gains. However, it underwent a significant correction in April and continued to decline in May due to disastrous ETF outflows and macroeconomic concerns. The flagship cryptocurrency is currently trading at $59,110. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has reiterated his long-standing criticism of Bitcoin, labeling it as a 'fraud' and a 'Ponzi scheme.' He also predicted that Bitcoin would not make significant progress as a currency. However, he acknowledged some value in blockchain technology."
5/4/2024,Bitcoin's Potential Rally in May: Factors and Indicators,"According to CryptoPotato, Bitcoin's price, which recently dipped, has started to recover, sparking speculation about a potential rally in May. Despite a promising start to the year and a surge to an all-time high price in March, Bitcoin's progress stalled in April. The primary cryptocurrency began May on a shaky note, declining to $56,800, the lowest level in nearly two months. However, the last few days have been slightly more optimistic, with Bitcoin reclaiming some lost ground and briefly spiking towards the $60,000 mark. ChatGPT, a popular AI-powered chatbot, was asked about the possibility of a more substantial rally and a new all-time high for Bitcoin this month. While the chatbot did not rule out the possibility, it outlined several factors that need to occur for such a price expansion. Favorable regulatory news was mentioned as a top contributing element. The approval of additional ETFs could result in a resurgence, according to ChatGPT. Another regulatory development that could positively impact the entire cryptocurrency market is a decisive victory for Ripple in its legal battle against the SEC. The second most important factor named by ChatGPT is institutional adoption. Increased adoption by large institutions, such as investment funds, banks, or corporations, can lead to significant inflows of capital into Bitcoin. Technological advancements, market sentiment, macroeconomic conditions, and supply dynamics were also added to the list of essential elements. Multiple indicators suggest that Bitcoin's correction might not last long. One example is the MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) metric, which has been experiencing a downfall since the beginning of April. A score above 3.5 suggests that the Bitcoin price is close to its peak, whereas a result below 1 warns about a bottom. The MVRV ratio plunged to 1.87 on May 2, flashing the buy signal for the asset. Another sign is the Bitcoin exchange netflow, which has been predominantly negative in the past two weeks. Shifting from centralized platforms to self-custody methods is considered bullish since it reduces the immediate selling pressure. The halving that took place last month, following which the miners’ rewards for validating blocks on the blockchain were slashed in half, has historically been a precursor of a major revival of the entire crypto sector."

5/4/2024,Block To Allocate 10% Of Bitcoin-Related Profits For Monthly BTC Purchases,"According to CryptoPotato, Block, the financial technology conglomerate owned by X co-founder Jack Dorsey, has announced plans to invest 10% of all profits from bitcoin-related products into monthly purchases. This decision was communicated to shareholders during a Q1 2024 earnings report, where Dorsey addressed concerns about Block's focus on the largest cryptocurrency. Dorsey explained that bitcoin is the only viable candidate for a decentralized open protocol for money, which he believes the world needs. He further stated that bitcoin would eventually become the native currency of the internet, eliminating the need for hundreds of payment schemes and intermediaries.

Dorsey believes that it's only a matter of time before the internet, including artificial intelligence systems, adopts a native currency, and bitcoin is the most efficient protocol for this. In addition to monthly purchases, Block is also developing Bitcoin mining hardware, including a mining rig system and a three-nanometer ASIC mining chip.

5/5/2024,Billionaire Investor and Analyst Debate Bitcoin's Role as Inflation Hedge,"According to U.Today, a live debate on YouTube, organized by ZeroHedge, saw billionaire investor Anthony Scaramucci of SkyBridge Capital and top analyst Peter Schiff discuss the role of Bitcoin ( ) and gold as inflation hedges. They were joined by Erik Voorhees, CEO of ShapeSchift, and Nouriel Roubini, a professor of economics at NYU. Peter Schiff, a critic of Bitcoin, initiated the debate by arguing that Bitcoin, originally created as a digital currency, fails to function effectively due to its slow and expensive nature. Schiff believes that Bitcoin proponents are trying to reposition it as a digital version of gold, but it falls short of gold's intrinsic value derived from its physical properties. He emphasized gold's tangible utility in industries like jewelry and electronics, contrasting it with Bitcoin, which he believes lacks practical uses and utility. Schiff asserted that gold retains its intrinsic properties over time, serving as a genuine store of value. He also argued that the perceived value of Bitcoin is merely based on speculative demand and does not reflect any inherent usefulness or practical applications.

He emphasized that Bitcoin, like gold, has a deflationary aspect due to its fixed supply. Scaramucci views Bitcoin as 'digital gold,' noting its portability compared to physical gold.

The cryptocurrency saw its value increase over the weekend due to a weakening dollar, but the overall market sentiment remains cautious. Bitcoin recently tested the 26-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), a significant technical threshold, which is proving to be a tough barrier. There is a possibility that Bitcoin may not break through this resistance. If it holds, Bitcoin could retest the $58,000 mark, a strong support level in recent months. The 100-day EMA is also around $60,000, reinforcing this critical price zone. The trading volume is somewhat neutral with a slight downward trend, not indicating a bullish reversal is on the horizon. This aligns with the broader market sentiment, as various risk indicators continue to suggest heightened caution. Liquidation of long positions has also been observed, slowing the momentum in perpetual markets. As this consolidation phase continues, Bitcoin enthusiasts and traders are closely watching to see if Bitcoin can break through the $65,000 resistance level. Such a move could potentially reenergize market sentiment and pave the way towards $70,000. However, the overall narrative remains bearish. Bitcoin's inability to break through key EMAs such as the 26 and 50, along with ongoing high-risk signals from market indicators, suggest that bears currently dominate. Observers are now waiting to see if Bitcoin can maintain its position above the $60,000 mark or if it will succumb to another round of sell-offs, confirming the bearish trend."

Over the past 24 hours, Bitcoin's price has seen mixed movements, falling from $65,500 to $62,830 on Monday, then rebounding to $63,600 today.

5/8/2024,High-Net-Worth Bitcoin Holders Embark on Unprecedented Buying Spree,"According to U.Today, Bitcoin analyst Willy Woo has highlighted a significant trend in the Bitcoin market, a surge in buying activity by high-net-worth holders. Over the past two months, these individuals or entities, also known as 'whales' within the crypto community, have been aggressively accumulating Bitcoin at unprecedented levels. The buying spree has been occurring while Bitcoin prices have been ranging between $60,000 to $70,000. These high-net-worth holders possess between 100 and 1000 , equating to roughly $6.5 million - $65 million of Bitcoin. This aggressive buying behavior raises questions about whether these whales have insights that the rest of the market does not. One possible explanation for this surge in activity could be their anticipation of a forthcoming bullish trend on the Bitcoin market. With institutional adoption on the rise, these whales may be positioning themselves ahead of a potential price rally, believing that current levels are an ideal entry point for accumulation. However, the specific motivations for the whales' buying frenzy remain unknown. Data from on-chain analytics firm IntoTheBlock reveals that Bitcoin whales, or addresses with more than 1,000 , have accumulated significantly in recent months, particularly during price dips. The firm has noticed a trend of dip buying among Bitcoin whales, albeit with waning conviction. 'Whales are buying the dip, but is their conviction dwindling? Addresses holding over 1000 BTC have accumulated strongly in recent months, especially during dips,' IntoTheBlock observed, adding that prices have risen shortly after each accumulation. However, a falling accumulation trend has been noted among these large Bitcoin holders, with each surge in accumulation less than the previous one. This could indicate that whales have less and less appetite to buy the dip. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was down 1.60% in the last 24 hours to $63,003."
5/9/2024,Swan Executive: Possible Yen Decline Could Benefit Bitcoin,"According to Cointelegraph: Swan Bitcoin executive, Dante Cook, suggests that if the dropping Japanese yen continues its decline it could spell catastrophe for US treasuries. This adverse scenario, however, could have a positive impact on Bitcoin ( ) as investors potentially seek alternative stores of value. According to Google finance data, currently, 1 JPY equals 0.0064 USD, losing 2.39% strength over the past 30 days. Cook warns that these deteriorating circumstances might manifest negatively for both Japan and the U.S as Japan remains the biggest holder of U.S. treasuries. Unless interventions by the U.S. government such as swaplines or backdoor liquidity are implemented, Cook argues that these could force Japan to offload its U.S. treasuries to support its own currency. Such a mass sell-off can incite unpredictability in traditional securities and send a ""massive wall of liquidity"" into the market, which could be advantageous to Bitcoin as an alternative safe haven for investors. Bitcoin ( ) has already been witnessing a wave of liquidity from institutional investors since the US SEC approved 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs in January. Apart from Bitcoin ( ), Cook suggests the present state of uncertainty in conventional financial markets could lead to increased interest in riskier crypto altcoins. In addition, he briefly mentions VanEck, a spot Bitcoin ETF issuer which has launched the MarketVector MEMECOIN index, underscoring the unreliability in traditional financial markets."

5/9/2024,Bitcoin's Price Action Around $61K Could Determine Its Next Move,"According to CryptoPotato, Bitcoin's price action around the critical 100-day moving average at $61K could dictate its next decisive move. After a modest bullish rebound from the substantial $59K support level, Bitcoin encountered selling pressure, retracing back to this pivotal juncture. The cryptocurrency has been in an extended sideways consolidation phase near the pivotal $60K price range. A sudden decline below the critical $59K level could trigger another notable downward movement toward the $56K threshold. However, this pivotal juncture also holds the potential to halt further downward pressures and provide mid-term support. Analysis of the 4-hour chart reveals heightened buying pressure near the critical $58K mark, resulting in a bullish surge toward the $66K threshold. However, increased selling pressure around $66K led to a noticeable downtrend, bringing the price back to the crucial $60K support region. Sellers are currently attempting to push the price below the significant $60K support level and the lower boundary of the wedge. If successful, it could signify a more sustained bearish phase, targeting the critical $56K support region. However, Bitcoin may continue consolidating or experience slight lower-level declines before gaining sufficient bullish momentum to initiate a fresh upward trend. Profitability is pivotal in market psychology, particularly when macroeconomic conditions don’t favor risk assets. Therefore, analyzing participants’ profitability offers valuable insights into the market’s state and sentiment. The Supply-in Profit (%) metric, representing the proportion of Bitcoin’s supply-in profit, has recently surged to its highest levels, indicating that many participants may be considering realizing profits, potentially leading to increased selling pressure. Historically, such elevated levels have often preceded market volatility and potential downturns as holders begin to liquidate their positions. However, despite a notable decline in the metric, the price has only undergone slight consolidation, suggesting that the recent decline might be a corrective movement triggered by profit realization. It’s plausible that once the correction stage concludes, the price will likely initiate a fresh, impulsive surge."

5/9/2024,Bitcoin Faces Longest Losing Streak Since Last October,"According to Bloomberg, Bitcoin is on the verge of experiencing its longest losing streak since October of the previous year. The overall cryptocurrency market has seen a 17% drop to $2.4 trillion following Bitcoin's mid-March record high of $73,798. This decline is attributed to the dwindling inflows into US funds, which had previously propelled Bitcoin to its all-time high after their launch in January. The group's overall net inflows currently stand at $11.8 billion, despite a $169 million outflow this month. Many speculators who were banking on the continuation of strong ETF flows are now being forced out of the market. In the derivatives market, there are indications that investors are anticipating fewer significant Bitcoin fluctuations compared to the volatility that accompanied the launch of the US ETFs. As of 7:10 a.m. in London on Thursday, Bitcoin's value was relatively stable at $61,660, while Ether saw a 2% increase to $3,009."

5/10/2024,Bitcoin Price Indications Suggest a Potential 'BLOW Higher' - Glassnode Founders' Analysis,"According to Cointelegraph: Bitcoin traders are keeping a keen eye on Bitcoin's weekly chart that's hinting towards the end of the downtrend with a bullish candle hammer. Glassnode founders, Jan Happel and Yana Allemann, indicated in a May 9 post on their shared X account, Negentropic, that ""Bitcoin still looks like it is about to BLOW higher."" Source: Mister Crypto The Bitcoin price chart closed on May 5 with a bullish hammer – a scenario where a ""wick"" or thin long line appears above a small body. Cryptocurrency trader, Mister Crypto, went on to support this by stating, ""Bitcoin weekly bullish hammer candle...reversal is imminent."" Traders are interpreting this as a possible signal of the downturn's reversal with an aggressive closing of prices near the candle open, suggesting a sentiment shift. Bitcoin’s price is down 8.93% over the last 30 days. Source: CoinMarketCap Negentropic explained, ""This week’s pullback seems like a healthy correction before higher.

5/10/2024,"Bitcoin Kimchi Premium Dips Amid Market Decline, Signifying Reduced Investor Enthusiasm in South Korea","According to CryptoPotato, the Bitcoin kimchi premium in South Korea has seen a significant drop amidst a wider market decline, indicating a decrease in enthusiasm among the country's digital asset investors. Data from CryptoQuant reveals that the Bitcoin kimchi premium fell to 1.5% during the afternoon trading session in Asia on Friday. The kimchi premium is a measure of the difference between Bitcoin's valuation on South Korean exchanges and global crypto trading platforms. The price of Bitcoin ( ) on South Korean exchanges differs from that on global platforms due to capital control policies that prevent foreign investors from trading on local platforms and local investors from participating in arbitrage trades. These restrictions have resulted in a limited supply of crypto in South Korea, leading to significant price gaps due to high demand. The kimchi premium has become a key indicator for monitoring changes in the crypto space and investor sentiment. A high premium indicates bullish investor sentiment compared to the international market, while a lower figure signifies bearish sentiment and decreasing buying pressure. With the premium currently at 1.54%, it appears that South Korean investors' interest in Bitcoin has waned. This trend is also reflected in the top local exchanges, which have seen a decrease in trading volumes, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The last time the Bitcoin kimchi premium was around its current level was in mid-February when was valued at approximately $48,200. By the first week of March, the index had risen to a 27-month high of 10.32%. It continued to increase in the following weeks, reaching 11.44% when BTC hit a new all-time high. However, the premium has been steadily declining since BTC fell from its all-time high and settled below $70,000. Since April, the crypto market has experienced a downturn, and the index has not been spared. BTC has fallen below $60,000, reaching $56,700 before bouncing back. At the time of writing, the asset was trading at $63,000, up 3.2% in the past 24 hours. Despite this, the current level of the kimchi premium could be a positive sign for the crypto market, as it suggests there is potential for a rally, and a significant BTC recovery could be on the horizon."

Dorsey emphasized that the actual price of Bitcoin is not the most interesting aspect of it, but rather the collaborative nature of its ecosystem and the way it encourages collective efforts to strengthen the network. Earlier this week, it was confirmed that Dorsey would be stepping down from the Bluesky board. Dorsey commented that Bluesky was 'essentially repeating all the mistakes made by Twitter' and added that it was not a protocol that could be considered truly decentralized. He suggested that the company's actions were beginning to resemble those of a traditional company pushing for auditing tools. Dorsey later deleted his Bluesky account, stating that the Nostr platform is an anonymous, open protocol, without any company or centralized control, aligning more with his goal of resisting censorship."

5/10/2024,Author Robert Kiyosaki Highlights Bitcoin's Potential Amid Economic Uncertainty,"According to U.Today, renowned author Robert Kiyosaki, famous for his book 'Rich Dad Poor Dad', recently shared his views on the current economic scenario and issued a warning to his followers. His message emphasized the potential of Bitcoin in the face of a predicted economic depression. Kiyosaki's latest post stressed the importance of preparing for adverse financial conditions. He encouraged his followers to step out of their financial ignorance, which he likened to a 'Disneyland', and take proactive steps to secure their wealth. He suggested smart investments in tangible assets such as gold, silver, and the increasingly popular cryptocurrency, Bitcoin. In an interesting turn, Kiyosaki reiterated his belief that economic downturns could be opportunities for wealth accumulation. He emphasized the need to shatter the illusion of prosperity and face the harsh realities of economic cycles. According to Kiyosaki, the impending depression could act as a catalyst for proactive wealth-building, urging people to seize the opportunity and prepare for the future. This isn't the first time Kiyosaki has warned about economic instability. He believes that in times of fear, doubt, and uncertainty, Bitcoin emerges as a potential wealth accumulator due to its resilience against inflation and currency devaluation. Kiyosaki's optimistic outlook on Bitcoin's future price trajectory has drawn attention. Predictions of its value soaring to remarkable levels, including reaching $120,000 by the end of the year and an astounding half-million mark in the following year, have sparked discussions in financial circles."
5/11/2024,Bitcoin Mining Leader Core Scientific Reports Improved Financial Performance in Q1 2024,"According to CryptoPotato, Core Scientific, a leading company in Bitcoin mining, has reported a significant improvement in its financial performance for the first quarter of 2024. The company's net income was $210.7 million, a stark contrast to the net loss of $0.4 million reported for the same period in 2023. The total revenue for Q1 2024 surged to $179.3 million, up from $120.7 million recorded during the same period last year. The company's operating income also saw a substantial increase, reaching $55.2 million compared to $7.6 million in the previous year. The adjusted EBITDA soared to $88.0 million, reflecting an improvement from $40.3 million in the same period in 2023. Adam Sullivan, CEO of Core Scientific, attributed these positive results to the company's ability to navigate favorable market conditions and a focus on productivity and efficiency. He stated, 'We delivered outstanding results in the first quarter, earning more Bitcoin than any other publicly traded Bitcoin miner.' The financial results also show good performance across Core Scientific’s key revenue streams. Digital asset mining revenue surged to $150.0 million, driven by a 134% increase in the price of Bitcoin and a 20% increase in the self-mining hash rate. Hosting revenue also increased to $29.3 million, fueled by onboarding new digital asset mining clients. Sullivan mentioned that they’re actively considering repurposing over 500 megawatts of their operational infrastructure for high-performance computing, leveraging their access to 1.2 gigawatts of power. They also plan to increase their Bitcoin mining hash rate by introducing more energy-efficient miners while simultaneously developing a high-performance computing service. Sullivan emphasized that they’re well-positioned to tap into the opportunities presented by both markets. The company's success is attributed to several strategic initiatives undertaken during the quarter. Core Scientific retired $19 million in obligations shortly after the quarter’s end, strengthening its balance sheet and enhancing financial flexibility. The company also expanded its hosting offering by delivering 16 MW of infrastructure to high-performance compute customers ahead of schedule. The company completed the deployment of 28,400 new S19j XP miners and deployed the first shipment of approximately 2,500 S21 miners while also expanding its operational infrastructure by 21 MW at its Pecos, Texas, site. Sullivan stated that their 745 megawatts of operational, high-power data center infrastructure is key to their competitive edge. He emphasized that this advantage positions them uniquely, enabling them to leverage Bitcoin mining as a foundation for expanding into alternative compute hosting services."

5/11/2024,JPMorgan Chase Discloses Bitcoin ETF Holdings Despite CEO's Criticism,"According to U.Today, JPMorgan Chase, the largest bank in the US, has revealed its holdings in Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in a recent filing. Despite the bank's total Bitcoin ETF holdings being a modest $1.2 million, this move is seen as another indication of the growing acceptance of Bitcoin. Robert Mitchnick of BlackRock recently stated that major financial institutions, including pension funds, are gearing up to invest in Bitcoin ETFs. Mitchnick downplayed the recent slowdown in inflows, asserting that the financial giant continues to witness robust demand for Bitcoin exposure. In related news, Edmond de Rothschild (Suisse) S.A. now holds $4.2 million worth of Bitcoin ETF shares. Wells Fargo, another leading US bank, also revealed its Bitcoin ETF holdings in a regulatory filing. Despite these developments, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon remains a vocal critic of Bitcoin. In December, he suggested that the US government should consider shutting down the leading cryptocurrency. He recently referred to the flagship cryptocurrency as a 'Ponzi scheme.' Despite Dimon's criticism, JPMorgan launched a passively managed Bitcoin fund for its wealth clients in 2021. The bank was also listed among the authorized participants for BlackRock's record-breaking Bitcoin ETF last year. On Thursday, Bitcoin ETFs reported mixed flows. Grayscale's GBTC experienced significant outflows of over $43 million, which were not offset by BlackRock's relatively modest inflows of $14.2 million. Despite the negative ETF data, Bitcoin managed to bounce back to the $63,000 level before falling again."
5/11/2024,Bitcoin Maximalist Max Keiser Supports U.S. Banking Sector Crash Predictions,"According to U.Today, Bitcoin maximalist Max Keiser has voiced his support for predictions of an impending crash in the U.S. banking sector. Keiser's comments come in response to a piece published by Zerohedge, which discusses a potential future banking crisis as predicted by billionaire Barry Sternlicht, CEO of Starwood Capital Group. Sternlicht anticipates that U.S. regional and community banks, of which there are over 4,000, will start to fail at a rate of one or two each week. Sternlicht attributes this potential crisis to the Federal Reserve's decision to raise interest rates, a move that he believes will not be reversed in the near future. This decision was announced during a recent FOMC meeting. Sternlicht predicts that the real estate sector and local banks that work with it will be particularly affected. He suggests that, as in 2009, real estate loans are likely to suffer. Experts believe that the U.S. Federal Reserve is caught between allowing a banking crisis by keeping rates high, and letting inflation grow stronger and out of control by lowering interest rates. High rates may keep inflation in check, but crucial sectors of the economy that rely heavily on loans may struggle to survive in a higher-rate environment. Keiser's support for these predictions aligns with his belief that this situation is unfolding 'exactly as Satoshi planned it', referring to Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin. Keiser also supports the 'crash predictions' made by Robert Kiyosaki, author of 'Rich Dad Poor Dad'. Kiyosaki has frequently expressed his belief that the U.S. economy, along with the U.S. dollar, is on the brink of a crash. He advocates for investment in Bitcoin, gold, and silver, predicting that the prices of these assets will skyrocket in the near future. Kiyosaki has even predicted that Bitcoin will reach $100,000 by September of this year. Keiser agrees with Kiyosaki's predictions, believing that the U.S. economy is heading downhill at a rapid pace."
5/11/2024,British Court Postpones Final Verdict in Largest Bitcoin Laundering Case,"According to PANews, a 42-year-old British-Chinese woman, Jian Wen, has been found guilty by a UK court for her involvement in the country's largest Bitcoin laundering case. The court could sentence her to a maximum of 14 years in prison. Jian Wen's defense lawyer, Mark Harries, stated that due to the judge's busy schedule, the court has postponed the final verdict, initially scheduled for May 10th, to May 24th. During the investigation, UK police seized over 61,000 Bitcoins, the largest amount of cryptocurrency ever seized in the country.

Jian Wen was arrested in a two-bedroom apartment in South London. It is reported that she has returned to work at a restaurant and is living with her son. In the apartment, police found a handwritten note stating, 'I'll be dead if they break the code.'"

5/11/2024,"Japanese Firm Metaplanet Inc Acquires Additional Bitcoin, Mirroring MicroStrategy's Strategy","According to U.Today, Metaplanet Inc, a publicly traded Japanese company, has purchased another batch of Bitcoin ( ), aiming to emulate the success of MicroStrategy in Asia. The company announced that it has acquired an additional 18.8698 BTC, a transaction valued at 200 million yen ($1.2 million) that took place on April 23. This latest acquisition brings the company's total Bitcoin holdings to 117.7217 BTC, valued at 10,193,536 yen per BTC. The total value of Metaplanet's Bitcoin assets is now 1.2 billion yen, or $7,708,020. Metaplanet's initial foray into Bitcoin investment in April sparked a positive response in Asia's investment landscape. This sentiment mirrors the enthusiasm ignited in the United States in August 2020 when MicroStrategy made its first Bitcoin purchase. Currently, MicroStrategy is the second-largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, trailing only BlackRock Inc. Under the guidance of Chairman Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy regularly invests in Bitcoin. Its most recent purchase was in March when it acquired 12,000 BTC for $821.7 million, bringing its total holdings to 214,246 tokens valued at approximately $14 billion. Since Metaplanet began investing in Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency's price has experienced some volatility due to sporadic sell-offs. However, the market has largely regained its bullish optimism with the announcement of new mainstream firms investing in Bitcoin. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is experiencing a slight recovery, up 3.14% in 24 hours to $62,907.50. As Metaplanet continues to follow MicroStrategy's investment strategy, it is expected to see similar bullish returns in the long term."
5/11/2024,"Bitcoin ETF Outflows Could Pressure BTC Price, Predicts Peter Schiff","According to U.Today, Peter Schiff, a well-known critic of Bitcoin, anticipates that the recent negative flows in Bitcoin ETFs could exert downward pressure on the cryptocurrency's price. Schiff, often referred to as 'Dr. Doom', suggests that the current imbalance in the Bitcoin ETF market, characterized by a surplus of investors and a dearth of buyers, could be detrimental to Bitcoin's price performance. Schiff noted that when Bitcoin ETFs were launched four months ago, there were only buyers and no sellers. However, with the increase in the number of investors owning these ETFs, the potential supply of sellers has grown significantly. Coupled with a decrease in demand from new buyers, Schiff predicts that ETF outflows could soon exert significant downward pressure on Bitcoin's price. The launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. in January was marked by an opposite scenario, with only buyers and no sellers. However, as interest in buying these ETFs has stagnated, this imbalance could result in significant pressure on Bitcoin's price in the short term. Over the last 10 days, Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. have seen an outflow of $230 million. On May 1, the sector experienced its 'worst day', with $563.7 million erased in 24 hours, coinciding with a 5% drop in Bitcoin's price from $63,000 to below $60,000. The nature of the first generation of Bitcoin ETF holders is a topic of ongoing discussion. Some analysts believe that the segment was initially entered by 'paper hands', or less confident investors, while more confident holders are yet to come. Yesterday, spot Bitcoin ETFs registered a minor outflow of $11.3 million, according to CoinGlass data. While most funds showed positive dynamics, GBTC lost $43.4 million. At the time of reporting, Bitcoin was trading at $60,900, down almost 1% in the last 24 hours."
5/11/2024,"Bitcoin Price Rally Stalls, Market Consolidation Continues","According to CryptoPotato, Bitcoin's price rally has been on pause for the past few months as the market consolidates. However, this situation is expected to change soon, either positively or negatively. A technical analysis by TradingRage reveals that Bitcoin's price has been consolidating within a large descending channel on the daily chart. The channel's midline recently rejected the price to the downside, and the market is once again testing the $60K level. If this level breaks, there is a high likelihood that the channel will also break down, potentially leading to a significant drop towards the $52K support zone. The 4-hour chart provides a clearer picture. The price recently tested the channel's midline but was decisively rejected. Today's activity is particularly revealing, as the price has been dropping aggressively. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) also indicates values below 50%, suggesting that momentum is currently favoring sellers. If the $60K level breaks to the downside, the situation could worsen. An on-chain analysis by TradingRage shows that as Bitcoin's price struggles to continue its uptrend and record a new high, bears are seemingly preparing for a further decline. The exchange reserve metric and its 30-day standard moving average are rising, which is typically considered bearish. This indicates that investors are depositing their coins on exchanges to sell them. The rising exchange reserve metric, which has climbed above its 30-day moving average, is contributing to the recent correction.

5/12/2024,Global Bitcoin ETFs Hold 4.5% of Total Supply,"According to BlockBeats, as of May 10, global Bitcoin ETFs held a total of 949,756 Bitcoins, which accounts for approximately 4.5% of the total supply. In addition, over the past week, US spot Bitcoin ETFs have collectively purchased an additional 1,318 Bitcoins. Notably, GBTC was the only ETF that experienced a capital outflow during this period. This data, monitored by HODL15Capital, provides an insight into the current state of Bitcoin ETFs globally. The significant holdings of these ETFs underline the growing interest and investment in Bitcoin, particularly in the US. However, the capital outflow from GBTC indicates a potential shift in investor sentiment or strategy. It's important to note that these figures represent a snapshot of the market as of May 10. The dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market means that these figures can change rapidly. Investors and market watchers are advised to keep a close eye on these trends as they can significantly impact the overall cryptocurrency market."

Indicators hint at Bitcoin nearing its local bottom and also point towards a potential $350,000 peak during this cycle. Source: Rekt Capital According to crypto trader, Rekt Capital, ""Bitcoin has repeated 2016 history perfectly."" In a May 11 post, Rekt stated that Bitcoin offered a downside wick below the bottom of its current re-accumulation range, within three weeks after the Halving. The re-accumulation range at this cycle stage, according to Rekt, is any price below $61,081— and as per CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin currently sits below this at $60,901. Moreover, Bitcoin is in the ""last pre-halving retrace"" stage, which in 2016 saw a 48% spike just six months later. Source: Timothy Peterson However, Timothy Peterson, founder and investment manager at Cane Island Alternative Advisors, offers a much more bullish projection. He anticipates Bitcoin's current price may multiply sixfold by the start of 2025, suggesting a potential peak value of $175,000 - $350,000 in the next 9 months based on adoption and previous drawdowns. Another crypto trader, Daan Crypto, mentioned that Bitcoin’s price might be “hovering around” its local bottom. He drew parallels to a similar formation seen after the approval of 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs in January that led to a 32% price rise just a month later.

5/12/2024,Is an 'Explosive Rally' in Store for Altcoin Market? Crypto Analysts Monitor Key Indicators,"According to Cointelegraph: Despite the 20% dip experienced by altcoins over the last month, crypto traders remain positive, anticipating an ""explosive rally"", and cite the market to be in the ""disbelief stage"". The total altcoin market capitalization is down 17.55% over the past 30-days. Source: TradingView Crypto analyst Milkybull, in a May 11 post, explained the disbelief stage to their 66,600 X followers as a period where investors remain skeptical despite favorable market indications. Evidence of this skepticism is reflected by a significant 24 index points drop over the past 30 days on the Fear and Greed Index – with the ""Greed"" score standing currently at 56. The total altcoin market cap which excludes the top 10 cryptocurrencies, declined 17.55% over the past 30-days to $264.9 billion, as per TradingView data. However, it still manages to stay above the $250 billion support level, positioning itself potentially towards increased growth, says Rekt Capital on a May 12 post. Three key indicators that traders are focusing on include the 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), Stochastic RSI, and Bitcoin dominance. If the combined crypto market cap ""retests"" the EMA20 and crosses bullish on the Stochastic RSI - an elephant in the room, a crypto rally may be imminent, suggests Titan of Crypto on a May 11 post. Bitcoin's dominance, an indicator showing Bitcoin's market share relative to the overall crypto market, is an essential gauge of investor sentiment and risk appetite. At the moment, it stands at 54.7%, a 0.56% dip over the past week. Analyst Yoddha suggested on May 11, a further decline may indeed incite an altseason."

5/12/2024,Ethereum's Value Against Bitcoin Drops by 36.4% Over Two Years,"According to U.Today, the ratio between Ethereum's value and Bitcoin's value, known as the / metric, has failed to recover from a multi-year downtrend. Tuur Demeester, a seasoned Bitcoiner and author of the Bitcoin Reformation theory, noted that this key indicator has lost over a third of its value in two years. In his recent thread on X, formerly known as Twitter, Demeester highlighted that the ETH/BTC metric is down by 27.9% in the past 12 months. This decline is the result of a prolonged downtrend, with Ethereum losing 36.4% against Bitcoin over two years. The weekly, monthly, and six-monthly losses stand at 3.2%, 5.2%, and 13.7% respectively. Demeester attributed this long-term decline to Ethereum's migration to the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus 18 months ago. He pointed out that following this significant upgrade, Bitcoin became the only major cryptocurrency using the proof-of-work (PoW) consensus. Ethereum's founder, Vitalik Buterin, had previously criticized the PoW version for being too susceptible to centralization, describing it as a 'temporary stage' before the transition to PoS. The PoS ecosystem of Ethereum now boasts over 1 million active validators. Despite the recent decline, some followers of Demeester suggested that the / metric would show a 76,000% growth over a 10-year timeframe, rather than a 36.4% decrease. However, veteran trader Peter Brandt predicted that the ETH/BTC ratio could fall by 57% in the next three years, based on Demeester's model."
5/13/2024,BTC ETF Sees Net Outflow of $264 Million Amidst Market Slump,"According to BlockBeats, the market continues to be sluggish, with the ETF experiencing a net outflow of $264 million last week. Despite the softening employment data recently released, the financial situation remains relaxed. The stock market was not affected by the poor consumer confidence and inflation expectation data. Consumer confidence dropped from 77.2 last month to 67.4, while the one-year inflation expectation jumped from 3.2% to 3.5%. Overall, the macroeconomic surprise index has fallen to its lowest level in 1.5 years, and Citigroup's hard data indicator saw its largest single-day drop in a year last week. Although it is still too early to assert a 'hard landing', with consumer savings declining, PMI continuing to be sluggish, high interest rates dragging down credit demand, and the finally slowing job market, American consumers are indeed entering a weak phase. The market focus will be on this Wednesday's CPI data, which could be a key driver of medium-term price trends. Although the market does hope for lower inflation data to guide the narrative of inflation slowdown back, the recent market-led CPI fixing has been quite stable, with traders expecting a year-on-year increase of about 3.4% in May CPI, which may further slow down to around 3.1% in December. The short-term financial situation's relaxation will offset the weakness in consumer credit demand, and the trend of oil prices may drive the inflation trend and expectations before the end of the year. The trend of cryptocurrency prices is disappointing. During the New York trading session last Friday, fell sharply from 63.5k to 60.5k, with a slight outflow of 85 million from the ETF. The major global CEX reported a decline in spot trading volume in April, the first decline in about five months. As the spot price has been consolidating for most of the past 1-2 months, the price trend seems heavy, and existing investors naturally still lean towards the bulls. In addition, as trend traders sell bullish options to earn extra income, long-term participants have begun to use volatility to generate income in the current period of low sentiment, with implied volatility falling sharply."

5/13/2024,"Bitcoin Price Influenced By Interest Rate Expectations, Not Spot ETF Approval, Says CoinShares","According to PANews, CoinShares released a report last weekend stating that the factors influencing Bitcoin's price are no longer narratives about interest rates, as was the case when the spot Bitcoin ETF was approved in the United States in January this year. Since then, with the reduction of ETF flows, Bitcoin's price has realigned with market expectations of interest rates. The Federal Reserve faces a challenging dilemma: it needs to control ongoing inflation while supporting the sluggish U.S. economy. In the long run, this predicament could be beneficial for Bitcoin. Over the past week, market trends have been primarily influenced by macroeconomic factors. The research points out that consistency with June's interest rate expectations has strengthened, similar to the trend in 2023. Last week's GDP growth was lower than expected, while core PCE inflation data was much higher than anticipated, exacerbating stagflation concerns. Stagnant service sector growth and high price payments indicate significant price pressure. The Federal Reserve maintained a hawkish stance at its Wednesday meeting, causing a sharp drop in Bitcoin prices. However, the Federal Reserve's quantitative tightening (QT) announced in June was reduced to $25 billion, exceeding market expectations and highlighting its policy dilemma. The market expects the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates later this year to address the weak job market. The recent price drop has led to an outflow of funds from the U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF, with the average investment in the U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF being about $62,000. The market seems to be overreacting to short-term economic data, overlooking long-term sluggish growth and government debt issues. Given that the supply of Bitcoin is fixed, the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut (which may be larger and later than expected) will support Bitcoin prices. The market needs to focus on long-term trends and avoid being confused by short-term fluctuations."
5/13/2024,Bitfarms Faces Lawsuit Over Alleged Contract Breach and Wrongful Dismissal,"According to Bloomberg, Bitfarms, a prominent player in the Bitcoin mining industry, is facing a lawsuit filed by Morphy in the Superior Court of Ontario. The claim, filed on Friday, seeks compensation for an alleged breach of contract, wrongful dismissal, and aggravated and punitive damages. Bitfarms has responded to the allegations, stating that they believe the claims are baseless and they intend to defend themselves vigorously. Morphy has not yet responded to requests for comment. The Bitcoin mining industry is currently dealing with several challenges in 2024. These include rising energy costs, increased competition, and the aftermath of an April software-code update known as the 'halving.' This update has significantly reduced their primary revenue source. Despite Bitcoin prices skyrocketing in the first quarter, the production of new coins has seen a sharp decline. This is due to the surge in mining difficulty, a measure of the computing power required to generate Bitcoin tokens, during the same period. Bitfarms' shares have seen a significant drop this year, with a decline of around 40%. The stock closed at $1.73 on Friday."

5/13/2024,Peter Schiff Denies Owning Bitcoin Amid Market Uncertainty,"According to U.Today, Peter Schiff, a well-known critic of Bitcoin, has once again confirmed that he does not own any of the cryptocurrency, despite rumors suggesting otherwise. Schiff's latest comments come at a time when the position of Bitcoin, often referred to as digital gold, is uncertain in the market. Schiff has consistently compared the value and utility of Bitcoin unfavorably to traditional assets such as gold. In his recent remarks, Schiff compared the excitement around Bitcoin to being 'drunk on the Kool-Aid', suggesting that he sees the value of Bitcoin as largely imaginary and driven by collective belief rather than inherent worth. This view aligns with his previous statements on the dynamics of Bitcoin's price. Schiff has noted that the launch of Bitcoin ETFs initially led to a lack of sellers due to overwhelming buyer interest, which temporarily boosted prices. However, he anticipates that as more investors hold these ETFs, the increase in potential sellers will exceed buying demand, leading to price declines. Critics of Schiff often suggest that his continuous criticisms of Bitcoin are part of a personal branding strategy. They speculate that he might secretly own Bitcoin and use his public criticism as a way to draw attention to himself and his preferred investment, gold. This theory suggests that Schiff's criticism could be a calculated move to maintain relevance in social media channels. Regardless of whether Schiff's stance is a marketing strategy or a genuine belief, his statements are being noticed and analyzed. It's worth noting that Schiff has been correct in several instances when criticizing Bitcoin and the path it has chosen. However, Schiff also predicted Bitcoin's fall to all-time lows, ahead of significant rallies towards all-time highs."

5/13/2024,Crypto-Mining Companies Navigate Revenue Challenges Amid Market Fluctuations,"According to Bloomberg, crypto-mining companies, including Bitcoin miners, have been facing increased selling pressure. These companies have managed to offset their losses by earning more from transaction fees, which serve as an additional revenue stream apart from the mining subsidy. The introduction of several memecoins on Bitcoin following the halving led to a surge in fees as users were eager to pay miners at a higher rate to prioritize their transactions. However, these fees saw a significant drop as the memecoin frenzy subsided. Kaiko, in a report released on Monday, warned that if miners were compelled to sell even a small portion of their holdings in the coming month, it could negatively impact the markets. The report also noted that trading activity usually slows down and liquidity decreases during the summer months. Despite selling most of their reserves during the 2022 crypto meltdown, Bitcoin miners have been holding more over the past two years, thanks to a strong rebound in the digital-asset market. Two of the largest public Bitcoin mining companies, Marathon and Riot, hold 17,631 Bitcoin worth just over $1.1 billion and 8,872 Bitcoin worth over $500 million, respectively, as per Kaiko's report. Bitcoin's value increased by about 2% to approximately $62,730 on Monday, marking a 15% decrease from its all-time high of nearly $74,000 achieved in March. Marathon's shares remained relatively stable at around $17.05, reflecting a 27% decrease this year. Riot's stock, priced at $9.46, has also seen a decline of about 40% since the beginning of 2024."

5/13/2024,Dormant Bitcoin Wallets Transfer Over $60 Million Worth of BTC,"According to CryptoPotato, Bitcoin valued at over $60 million has been moved from dormant wallets that have been inactive for over a decade. The transfer took place yesterday and involved the movement of 1,000 , which is currently valued at $62.8 million. The data shows that two Bitcoin wallet addresses, which have been dormant since September 12, 2013, moved a total of 1,000 BTC. The transfers occurred in succession, with one address moving 500 BTC ($31.4 million) at 9:46 a.m. UTC, followed by a second identical transfer just 20 minutes later. These wallets had initially received 500 BTC each back in 2013 when Bitcoin was trading at around $124, which was approximately $62,000 in value at the time. Today, with Bitcoin's price close to $63,000, the value of the transferred fortune has surged more than 500 times over the past decade. The funds from the first wallet were further divided and sent to additional addresses, while those from the second are yet to be moved. The reason behind these transfers and the identity of the wallet owners remain unknown. However, the similarity in transfer amounts and the closeness of transactions suggest a potential connection between the two addresses. This recent event is not an isolated incident in the crypto space. Earlier this year, a Bitcoin whale moved 2,000 , valued at $140 million, after lying dormant for 14 years. This transfer involved 40 sets of mining rewards, each consisting of 50 BTC, accumulated over a decade into one wallet. Such movements of dormant Bitcoin have become increasingly common. Last week alone, 687.33 BTC, worth over $44 million, was moved for the first time in a decade. In March, the fifth richest address on the Bitcoin blockchain, dormant since 2019, transferred $6 billion worth of the asset to three new wallets. The transfer took place against a backdrop of increased institutional interest in Bitcoin caused by its price surpassing $70,000. In January, nearly 50,000 dormant BTC became active less than a week after the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the United States, hinting at a potential correlation between regulatory developments and dormant activity."

His recent post included an AI-generated image of a woman resembling Sarah Connor, a character from the Terminator movies, with a Bitcoin mascot on her shirt and the phrase 'No fate'. Saylor encouraged the Bitcoin community to shape their own future with Bitcoin. In addition to Saylor's Terminator-themed message, he has been increasing his engagement with the crypto community, spreading the 'good tidings' of Bitcoin to as many people as possible. In a recent tweet, he urged Bitcoin enthusiasts to educate their mothers about the cryptocurrency. Another prominent Bitcoin advocate, Robert Kiyosaki, author of 'Rich Dad Poor Dad', recently expressed his support for Bitcoin on social media. Kiyosaki believes that the US dollar is on the brink of a significant crash due to rumors of BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) launching a gold-backed cryptocurrency in the near future. If this happens, Kiyosaki predicts that billions of US dollars will flow back into the US, further devaluing the dollar. As a result, he advises his followers to invest in Bitcoin, gold, and silver to protect themselves from the potential crash of the US dollar. Despite his reputation for making predictions about the US economy and the dollar, many have stopped paying attention to his forecasts."

Earlier in the year, UBS had made the decision to permit certain customers to trade Bitcoin ETFs. However, this option was not extended to accounts with a lower risk tolerance. Furthermore, UBS is not expected to actively seek out Bitcoin ETF traders. In 2023, UBS had also allowed some of its wealthier clients to gain exposure to cryptocurrency ETFs based in Hong Kong. UBS was listed as an authorized participant for BlackRock's IBIT, alongside other major entities such as Citadel and Goldman Sachs, back in April. Despite former UBS CEO Ralph Hamers dismissing cryptocurrencies as mere 'speculation' in 2021, Bitcoin ETFs have continued to gain popularity, even in the face of recent outflows. On May 9, Edmond de Rothschild (Suisse) S.A., a part of the renowned Edmond de Rothschild Group, purchased $4.2 million worth of shares in Bitcoin ETFs. Last week, JPMorgan Chase, the top US bank in terms of assets under management, also disclosed its holdings in Bitcoin ETFs. Trading firm Susquehanna International Group (SIG), co-founded by billionaire Jeff Yass, has likewise joined the Bitcoin ETF trend. Robert Mitchnick from BlackRock recently disclosed that major institutions are currently exploring Bitcoin."
5/14/2024,"Bitcoin Expected To Maintain Current Trading Range, Says Galaxy Digital Founder","According to Odaily, Michael Novogratz, the founder of digital asset financial services company Galaxy Digital Holdings Ltd., has predicted that Bitcoin may continue to trade within a relatively narrow range of $55,000 to $75,000 in the current quarter. He also noted that the adoption of cryptocurrency in traditional finance is ongoing. Novogratz believes that the market may maintain a similar situation in the current and next quarter until two potential turning points occur: the start of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, which usually signifies an economic slowdown, or the end of elections, which could bring some clarity to the regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies."
5/14/2024,VanEck's Bitcoin ETF HODL Reports Q1 Financials,"According to Foresight News, VanEck's digital assets division has released the first quarter financial report for its Bitcoin ETF, HODL, up to March 31. The report reveals that the Bitcoin investment was 8711 , approximately $619 million. The net assets increased by $109 million, and the total Bitcoin investment liabilities were $20 million. The realized net income was $6 million. As of April 30, HODL held 8.2 million shares."
5/14/2024,Bitcoin Shows Potential For Significant Recovery Amid ETF Activities,"According to U.Today, Bitcoin is demonstrating potential for a significant recovery, influenced by recent ETF activities and price stabilization. The Hong Kong Bitcoin Spot ETF reported a net redemption of 519.5 Bitcoins on May 13, reducing the total number of Bitcoins held to 3,560. This ETF has seen net redemptions for three consecutive days, with a single-day turnover of $4.25 million and total net assets of $219 million. The HK Spot ETF, on the other hand, holds 13,350 ETH. This trend of redemptions is not exclusive to Hong Kong; Bitcoin ETFs in Western markets are also witnessing similar patterns. Although the initial reaction to net redemptions might appear bearish, these outflows can actually serve as bullish indicators as they often trail market sentiment. The current absence of inflows suggests that retail investors are regaining control, which could lead to a price recovery for Bitcoin. An analysis of the Bitcoin price chart supports this optimistic perspective. The chart shows Bitcoin consolidating around a crucial support level. The 50-day moving average is positioned above the 200-day moving average, indicating a potential bullish trend. Furthermore, the RSI is around 50, suggesting that Bitcoin is neither overbought nor oversold, providing room for upward movement. Volume analysis reveals increased buying activity during recent dips, indicating strong support from buyers at lower price levels. This accumulation phase often precedes a price rally, as investors capitalize on lower prices to build their positions. The market's stabilization and the lack of significant inflows into ETFs suggest that retail investors might be preparing for a price recovery. Historically, when retail investors regain control, it often results in a more sustained and organic price increase."
5/14/2024,Grayscale GBTC Experiences Net Outflow While Franklin EZBC Sees Inflow,"According to PANews, on May 14th, Grayscale GBTC experienced a net outflow of $51 million. In contrast, Franklin EZBC saw an inflow of $2 million. The data was monitored and reported by HODL15Capital. This financial movement indicates a shift in investment patterns within these entities. However, the specific reasons behind these changes remain unclear. Further details and implications of this financial activity are yet to be analyzed."
5/14/2024,Bitcoin Network Fundamentals Remain Strong Despite Market Fluctuations,"According to CryptoPotato, despite the crypto market's distance from its March peak, Bitcoin's foundational strength is still robust. This strength is highlighted by key factors such as the persistence of long-term holders and a decrease in mining difficulty, suggesting the network is well-positioned for future value appreciation. On-chain data shows that long-term holders have been retaining their bitcoins ( ) for the past two weeks, indicating strategic positioning for potential entry points at market lows. In contrast, short-term holders are still realizing profits and increasing selling pressure. This could be a sign of panic and a liquidity shift towards altcoins, potentially reversing price rallies if not supported by long-term investor purchases. If these market dynamics continue, it could be inferred that the short-term bottom is in and Bitcoin's current multi-month range could trend upwards. In addition, Bitcoin's mining difficulty has decreased by 6%, the largest drop since December 2022. This difficulty, which measures the number of hashes needed to validate a Bitcoin block, adjusts automatically every two weeks or 2,016 blocks. The decrease in mining difficulty suggests a decline in the number of Bitcoin miners, making it less challenging to validate new blocks. This reduction in competition benefits the remaining miners, as a 6% decrease in difficulty equates to roughly a 6% increase in Bitcoin earnings for the same computational effort. Furthermore, Bitcoin recently processed its one billionth transaction, highlighting significant activity on the network. On May 6, when Bitcoin reached this milestone, over 625,000 transactions were executed on the network, demonstrating the blockchain's health and adoption as a digital asset. The recent increase in Bitcoin activity over the past year can be attributed to the introduction of new protocols like Ordinals and Runes and the spot exchange-traded funds market, which has increased the network's usage. However, despite Bitcoin's growth and development, BTC is currently struggling to maintain stability above the $63,000 level due to negative economic indicators from the United States. At the time of writing, the asset had fallen approximately 2% in the past 24 hours and was trading below $61,600."
5/14/2024,Grayscale Highlights Bitcoin's 'Renaissance' With New Layer 2 Developments,"According to CryptoPotato, Grayscale, a leading crypto asset management firm, has highlighted a 'renaissance' in Bitcoin development, with several new Layer 2s (L2s) showing promise. In a recent investor report, Grayscale analyst Michael Zhao discussed how these technologies could introduce new use cases for Bitcoin and stimulate more market demand for . Zhao first mentioned Bitcoin Virtual Machine (BitVM) as one of Bitcoin's 'most anticipated' next-generation applications. BitVM, a new computing model for verifying computations on Bitcoin, was introduced by Robin Linus in October. It opens the network to smart contract functionality, which is more familiar to Ethereum. One of the key applications of BitVM in development is optimistic Bitcoin rollups, which allow users to batch fast, cheap transactions together in off-chain environments before settling them back to Bitcoin in one piece. Another technology spotlighted by Grayscale is Spiderchains, developed by Botanix Labs. Spiderchains are layer 2 chains secured by staked Bitcoin ( ) within decentralized multi-signature wallets. Users' pegged Bitcoin assets are secured by a rotating subset of 100 'orchestrators' that manage the layer 2 chain, which can feature any functionality seen on other blockchains, like Bitcoin. Babylon is also expanding the Bitcoin 'staking' world through its BTC re-staking technology. This would enable BTC holders to stake their coins and earn yield on them by using them to secure other blockchain networks, like Solana or Ethereum, if the latter networks were upgraded to allow for it. Lastly, projects like Taproot Assets aim to bring tokenization, specifically stablecoins, to one of Bitcoin's most popular current L2s: the lightning network. Grayscale believes that Bitcoin's underdeveloped smart contract ecosystem could be a massive untapped market. For instance, while about 17% of Ethereum's total market cap ($360 billion) is currently used in applications, the value locked in Bitcoin dapps is still just 0.2% of its total market cap ($1.2 trillion). If the latest wave of development results in more adoption for these use cases, it could imply a larger addressable market and potentially a higher market value over time, Grayscale concluded."
5/14/2024,National Pension Fund Purchases BlackRock's Bitcoin Spot ETF,"According to BlockBeats, Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas announced on social media on May 14 that the National Pension Fund purchased BlackRock's Bitcoin Spot ETF (IBIT) in the first quarter. Typically, these institutional 'whales' do not buy in until about a year later when the ETF gains more liquidity. However, this time is different and is a good sign, with expectations of more institutions disclosing their actions, as they often act collectively. Previously, BlockBeats reported that according to official documents disclosed by the SEC, the State of Wisconsin Investment Board currently holds $99 million of BlackRock's Bitcoin Spot ETF IBIT, as per the information in the SEC's 13F form. This move by the National Pension Fund is seen as a positive sign for the cryptocurrency market, indicating increased institutional interest and investment in Bitcoin."
5/14/2024,Veteran Trader Predicts XRP's Downward Price Trajectory Against Bitcoin,"According to U.Today, Peter Brandt, a seasoned trader, has given a stark evaluation of 's price movement compared to Bitcoin ( ), using traditional charting principles. Brandt's analysis indicates that XRP's chart pattern is on a downward slope, possibly heading towards zero. The chart Brandt shared shows XRP's price against Bitcoin, currently at 0.0000084 BTC, its lowest point in recent history. Brandt's analysis calls for a critical review of the optimism surrounding XRP, especially when juxtaposed with Bitcoin. He points out that XRP has only closed higher than its current levels in six of the past 126 months, suggesting a long period of underperformance. While Brandt acknowledges the potential for XRP to outperform BTC in the future, he emphasizes that the onus of proof lies with XRP. He suggests that investors looking at alternative cryptocurrencies might find more promising opportunities than XRP. Brandt's cautionary comments highlight the challenges faces in a market dominated by Bitcoin and a plethora of competing altcoins. His observations add to the ongoing debate about XRP's price trajectory, leading investors to question the sustainability of its current levels. As one of the largest and most popular coins, XRP continues to be in the crypto market spotlight. However, what this means for its price and consequently for investors' portfolios remains a significant question."
5/14/2024,"CNBC Host Jim Cramer Advises Against Buying MicroStrategy Stock, Suggests Direct Bitcoin Investment Instead","According to U.Today, Jim Cramer, the host of CNBC's 'Mad Money', has recently advised his audience against purchasing stocks from business intelligence firm MicroStrategy. Instead, he suggests that those interested in gaining exposure to Bitcoin should directly invest in the cryptocurrency. MicroStrategy has significantly outperformed Bitcoin on a year-to-year basis, and investment banking company TD Cowen predicts that the stock could see a substantial surge this year. The firm's entry into Bitcoin ETFs could be a major bullish catalyst, according to TD Cowen. The company is also expected to benefit from the anticipated rejection of Ethereum-based spot ETFs later this month. MicroStrategy's CEO, Michael Saylor, has stated that Bitcoin ETFs would not pose a threat to the company as they charge fees, while MicroStrategy offers 'intelligent leverage' without any charges. In their Q1 results last month, MicroStrategy reported a net loss of $53.1 million. The Bitcoin-related paper gains made by the company in Q1 were not reflected in the recent report as the firm has not yet adopted the new accounting rule. Last month, broker Benchmark suggested that the company could be included in the S&P 500 index if it were to adopt the new accounting standard. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) allowed companies to report digital currencies on their balance sheets at fair value starting from 2025, but the new rules could be adopted earlier. MicroStrategy has been performing well due to the Bitcoin bull run, despite coming close to receiving a margin call in 2022 when the cryptocurrency saw a significant drop. Cramer had previously criticized Saylor on social media for the pressure on MicroStrategy's stock due to its borrowing against crypto, suggesting that the company must have a plan to prevent the margin call from being triggered."

5/15/2024,Bitwise CIO Predicts Increase in Bitcoin ETF Allocations,"According to Odaily, Matt Hougan, the Chief Investment Officer at Bitwise, has shared his predictions regarding Bitcoin ETF allocations. He stated that the recent Bitcoin ETF allocations disclosed in the 13F filings submitted to the SEC are just the 'down payment'. Hougan anticipates that the proportion of spot Bitcoin ETF allocations in investors' portfolios will rise to 1-5%. This is because most professional investors require a period of 6 to 12 months to evaluate cryptocurrencies. They follow a pattern of due diligence, personal allocation, isolating client allocation, and full platform allocation. Hougan's comments highlight the growing interest in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies among professional investors. However, it's important to note that these predictions are based on current trends and the actual outcomes may vary depending on various factors, including market conditions and regulatory developments. As such, investors are advised to conduct their own research and consult with a financial advisor before making any investment decisions."
5/15/2024,Bitcoin Miners' Revenues Show Signs of Decrease Following Halving Event,"According to CryptoPotato, nearly a month after the fourth Bitcoin halving, the first signs of a decrease in miners' revenues are slowly emerging. The network hash rate's drop is a clear indicator of this trend, potentially signaling miner capitulation, where less efficient miners quit due to decreased profitability. The 30-day moving average of the hash rate previously peaked at 630 exahashes per second (EH/s), but it has now dropped to 606 EH/s. This decrease, although relatively small and brief, is significant as the hash rate usually increases, indicating a shift in the pattern. CryptoQuant's analysis revealed instances of rapid declines in the hash rate, often signaling 'miner capitulation.' This term refers to less efficient miners exiting the process, shutting down their rigs, and reducing the computational power for mining. They may also relocate or sell recently mined bitcoin to cover their operational expenses. The Hash Ribbons indicator, which operates under the assumption that these conditions often coincide with substantial price declines, was highlighted in CryptoQuant's analysis. However, it's important to note that this doesn't happen immediately after the initial capitulation signal from Hash Ribbons. Instead, the process of miner capitulation is steady and happens gradually over the subsequent days and weeks as less efficient miners leave the market. The halving event on April 20 cut the block reward in half to 3.125 BTC, reducing mining output from 900 BTC to around 450 BTC per day. As a result, major Bitcoin miners such as Bitfarms, Cipher, CleanSpark, Core Scientific, Riot, and Terawulf experienced production drops of 6% to 12% in April. These output reductions have coincided with a decline in profitability, or 'hash price,' which has decreased to $0.049 per terahash per second per day, according to HashRateIndex. This represents a drop of over 73% from the $0.182 TH/s/day level seen around the halving. Such a scenario also spells trouble for Bitcoin's price as sell-off concerns amidst increasing pressure faced by miners."

5/15/2024,"Bitcoin Predicted to Surge, Says Dan Tapiero and Robert Kiyosaki","According to U.Today, Dan Tapiero, co-founder of Gold Bullion International and 10T Holdings, has shared a bullish prediction for Bitcoin's price. He suggests that the cryptocurrency's chart setup is looking 'scary bullish' and anticipates a break above the $65,000 level, potentially reaching $90,000 or higher. Tapiero believes the current sideways consolidation is nearly complete, although he has not identified a specific catalyst for the expected bull run. Over the past 24 hours, Bitcoin's value has decreased by 3.18%, followed by a 1.29% growth. The cryptocurrency is currently trading at $61,950. Since losing the $65,000 level on May 6, Bitcoin has been attempting to recover, with two unsuccessful attempts to break through the $63,300 zone. Many expect Bitcoin to skyrocket later this year or in 2025, following the halving event in April that reduced the block reward size to 3.125 . Historically, Bitcoin has always surged after each of the three previous halvings. Another potential price catalyst is the continued purchase of Bitcoin by spot ETFs, which began their regular accumulation in January after receiving SEC approval for trading. In related news, Robert Kiyosaki, author of the popular financial management book 'Rich Dad Poor Dad,' has also endorsed Bitcoin. He predicts a crash in the U.S. dollar due to rumors of BRICS planning to launch its own gold-backed cryptocurrency. Kiyosaki suggests that this could result in billions of U.S. dollars flowing back into the U.S., causing the dollar to crash. He recommends buying Bitcoin, gold, and silver as protection against this potential negative development."
5/15/2024,Japanese Firm Metaplanet Adopts Bitcoin As Reserve Asset Amid Economic Pressures,"According to CryptoPotato, Metaplanet, a Japanese investment and consulting company listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, has incorporated Bitcoin into its long-term financial strategies. The firm has adopted Bitcoin as its reserve asset in its treasury management strategy. Metaplanet will prioritize a Bitcoin-first, Bitcoin-only approach, using long-dated Japanese yen liabilities and periodic share issuances as financial options to continually purchase more . The company views Bitcoin as fundamentally superior to any other forms of political currency, traditional stores of value, and investment, and all other crypto-assets/securities. Metaplanet's announcement comes a month after the firm invested one billion JPY ($6.5 million) into BTC, marking its transition to the leading crypto asset. The move is a response to the economic pressures on Japan, the weak yen, long periods of negative interest rates, and high government debt levels. Japan's challenging economic landscape saw the yen fall to 34-year lows a few weeks ago, amounting to a 50% depreciation against the USD in the past decade. Metaplanet explained that the country's unsustainable financial trajectory suggests an increasing rate of monetary devaluation in the future. Japan's debt-to-gross domestic product ratio is 261%, the highest in the developed world. The Bank of Japan implemented a negative interest rate policy in 2016 and artificially suppressed borrowing costs by printing the yen to purchase government bonds. Metaplanet's Bitcoin strategy would fortify its balance sheet against further devaluation of the yen and position the company as a -focused investment vehicle."
5/15/2024,Bitcoin Price Rises in Response to Slowing U.S. Inflation,"According to CNBC: The price of Bitcoin ( ) surged in response to indications of decreasing inflation in the United States. The cryptocurrency's price escalated over 5% to $64,910.57, marking its best performance since March 25, based on data from Coin Metrics. Analyst Owen Lau from Oppenheimer highlighted that a lower-than-expected Consumer Price Index (CPI) figure increases the likelihood of a rate cut, a crucial factor influencing Bitcoin's price. The U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics disclosed that the consumer price index, a broad gauge of goods and services, climbed 0.3% from March, slightly below the Dow Jones estimate of 0.4%. Despite being 3.4% higher than a year ago, consumer prices have begun to show signs of slowing down. While the potential for rate cuts remains uncertain, it might ignite a renewed investor appetite for riskier assets, such as cryptocurrencies. This, in turn, could stimulate increased flows into Bitcoin spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs).     "
5/15/2024,Matrixport Report Suggests Bitcoin Undervalued Despite Nasdaq Index Reaching Historic High,"According to Odaily, Matrixport has released a report indicating that despite the Producer Price Index (PPI) in the United States exceeding expectations, the Nasdaq Index still managed to reach a historic high. The report suggests that Bitcoin appears to be undervalued, as it is 5% lower than the Nasdaq Index, despite a 30-day correlation of 42% between the two. This high correlation implies that Bitcoin should also reach new highs as the Nasdaq Index does. The report's findings are significant as they suggest a potential undervaluation of Bitcoin in comparison to the Nasdaq Index. This could indicate a potential opportunity for investors, as the high correlation between the two suggests that Bitcoin's value could increase in line with the Nasdaq Index. It's important to note that while the report suggests a potential undervaluation of Bitcoin, this does not guarantee future performance. Investors should always conduct their own research and consider their own risk tolerance before making investment decisions."

5/15/2024,"Bitcoin (BTC) Could Reach $100K If U.S. High-Yield Rate Drops Below 7%, Suggests Crypto Analyst","According to Cointelegraph: Bitcoin's valuation could exceed $100,000, but only if the U.S. high-yield rate goes down below 7%, as per crypto analyst Timothy Peterson. He asserts that the high-yield rate, which is currently at 7.54%, is a crucial indicator for predicting Bitcoin's chance of surpassing its all-time high of $73,700 in 2024. Peterson suggests that if the high-yield corporate bond rate falls within the 6-7% range, Bitcoin ( ) could potentially reach the much-awaited $100,000 mark by the fourth quarter of 2024 or latest by the second quarter of 2025. The anticipated lowering of interest rates by the U.S. Federal Reserve is projected to take place in September, as predicted by nearly two-thirds of economists in a recent survey. The slash in rates might result in a hike in Bitcoin ( ) investments as traders look for riskier yet higher yielding assets. Bitcoin trades at $61,871 at the time of writing, down 5.08% over the past 30 days.

The ETF aims to provide 100% downside protection for Bitcoin, while also utilizing FLEX options to capture some of the upside. At this point, it is not clear whether the application is for a spot or futures type. Eric Balchunas, a Bloomberg ETF analyst, made the announcement on platform X. The specifics of the application, including whether it is for a spot or futures type, remain unclear. The proposed ETF is designed to offer investors a way to gain exposure to Bitcoin with a level of protection against downside risk. The use of FLEX options suggests that the ETF will also seek to benefit from potential increases in the value of Bitcoin. This move by Calamos represents a growing trend among asset management companies to explore the potential of cryptocurrencies as an investment option. The introduction of a 'Buffer' ETF could provide a safer way for investors to enter the volatile cryptocurrency market.

5/16/2024,"Bitcoin Mining Costs Estimated At $45,000, Says Recent Study","According to BlockBeats, a recent study by JPMorgan Chase on May 16th suggests that the current hash rate and power consumption of the Bitcoin network indicate an estimated mining cost of around $45,000. The report highlights that the more the price of Bitcoin falls, the greater the number of unprofitable miners facing pressure to leave the Bitcoin network. This, in turn, leads to a larger decrease in the hash rate and the cost of Bitcoin production (mining). JPMorgan Chase had previously predicted a significant drop in hash rate following the halving due to unprofitable miners exiting the network. This situation is now unfolding, albeit with some delay. Analysts also noted that the boost from halving is temporary, with user activity and fees sharply declining in the past one to two weeks. This underscores the ongoing challenges Bitcoin miners face in maintaining a sustainable source of Bitcoin, especially in a post-halving environment."

He described Bitcoin ( ) as a cultural phenomenon, referring to it as the ' -ing of Life.' This comparison comes at a time when meme-inspired cryptocurrencies are gaining popularity in the market. Saylor's comment is particularly noteworthy given the current meme frenzy in the cryptocurrency market. Despite the rise of various animal-themed tokens, Saylor underscores Bitcoin's central role in this cultural narrative. Memes, defined as ideas or behaviors that spread virally within a culture, often symbolize specific themes or phenomena. Saylor's analogy positions Bitcoin not just as a digital currency, but also as a symbolic representation of wider societal changes in finance and technology. As Saylor continues to shed light on the importance of Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency itself is on an upward trend. It is currently trading at $66,000 after a significant 7.5% increase, staying close to its recent highs, despite a minor drop of about 12%. Several analysts, including famed trader Peter Brandt, are predicting further upward movement in Bitcoin's price. Predictions suggest a potential retest of the $74,000 mark, the current all-time high, fostering optimism within the crypto community. However, as with any market forecast, only time will confirm the accuracy of these predictions."

5/17/2024,BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF Surpasses Rivals in Key Metrics,"According to U.Today, BlackRock's IBIT, the largest spot Bitcoin ETF, has outperformed its competitors in terms of the amount of Bitcoin held and another significant metric. Eric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst for Bloomberg, revealed this information in a recent tweet. Balchunas reported that the fund had an astonishing 414 reported holders in its first 13F season. This figure is remarkable, according to the analyst, who added that it 'blows away [the] record.' Balchunas further explained that even if a newly launched ETF manages to attract 20 holders, it is considered a significant and rare achievement. He also provided a comparison of BlackRock's performance with some of the other largest spot Bitcoin ETFs. Bitwise's BITB has approximately 100 reported holders, Fidelity's FBTC has just under 250, and Ark Invest has fewer than 100.

5/17/2024,Bitcoin's Correlation With Tech Stocks Reaches Highest Level Since August 2023,"According to BlockBeats, during the last Federal Reserve interest rate hike cycle, Bitcoin and other speculative investments plummeted due to the expectation that the rate hike would suppress risk appetite. Now, with the market once again optimistic about the potential for borrowing costs to drop quickly, supporters of the largest market cap cryptocurrency say that Bitcoin is more akin to high-growth assets like tech company stocks. This has been reflected in recent Bitcoin trading activity. The 90-day correlation coefficient of digital currency and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index reached 0.46 this week, the highest level since late August 2023. A correlation coefficient of 1 means assets move in sync, while -1 indicates they move in opposite directions. After the Federal Reserve began raising the target interest rate for overnight interbank loans in early 2022, the correlation jumped to over 0.8. This suggests that Bitcoin's behavior is increasingly tied to that of tech stocks, which could have implications for investors looking to diversify their portfolios. The correlation between Bitcoin and tech stocks could be a sign of the cryptocurrency's maturation as an asset class, as it begins to behave more like traditional financial assets."

Other banking giants, including JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and UBS, also reported holdings in spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds during the first quarter. However, these purchases do not necessarily reflect the banks' perspectives on the future price of bitcoin. Instead, they were likely made on behalf of the banks' wealth management clients or were necessary for market making and/or ETF authorized participant duties. Morgan Stanley began offering spot bitcoin ETF allocations to its clients shortly after their approval in January. However, these were only available on an unsolicited basis, meaning that the client had to propose the investment to the broker."

5/17/2024,Millennium Management Holds Over $2 Billion in Bitcoin ETFs,"According to U.Today, Millennium Management, a leading hedge fund, now holds over $2 billion in Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). The fund has acquired shares from various products including BlackRock's IBIT, Fidelity's FBTC, and Grayscale's GBTC. The hedge fund, established by American billionaire Israel Englander, is currently leading the list of ETF holders. Companies were required to submit 13F forms before the May 15 deadline, allowing industry observers to gauge the current rate of Bitcoin ETF adoption.

Other Bitcoin ETF holders include Pine Ridge Advisers, Edmond de Rothschild (Suisse), JPMorgan, Well Fargo, and Susquehanna International Group.

5/17/2024,"Bitcoin's Short-Term Charts Indicate Potential Correction, Says Crypto Analyst","According to U.Today, a sell signal on Bitcoin's short-term charts has been presented by the TD Sequential, a popular indicator, says crypto analyst Ali. This development has sparked interest as it suggests a potential correction for Bitcoin ( ) over the next one to four candlesticks. On Bitcoin's four-hour chart, the TD Sequential indicator has flashed a sell signal, indicating that the current uptrend may be nearing its end and a short-term correction could be on the horizon. While the TD Sequential is not a guarantee of future price movements, its historical accuracy may make it a useful tool for traders monitoring short-term price movements. However, it is crucial to consider the broader context of Bitcoin's price action. At the time of writing, BTC had risen 1.80% in the last 24 hours to $65,736 after hitting highs of $66,772 in the day's trading session. BTC surged to over $66,000 on Wednesday as U.S. inflation data increased the likelihood of the Fed reducing interest rates in the coming months. Like other risk assets, BTC is vulnerable to anticipated changes in major central banks' monetary policy. Following the most recent data release, Bitcoin was observed wiping out its gains at the time of writing, along with several major cryptocurrencies. The latest data suggests that U.S. weekly jobless claims remain high, while April import and export prices both saw significant monthly increases. Import prices rose 1.1% in April. Currently, 's daily 50-day SMA at $65,111 is being watched to act as an intermediate support to stop BTC's current price declines. Bulls may need to defend this key support level to prevent declines near $60,000. On the flip side, if buyers maintain the BTC price above the 50-day simple moving average, this could trigger a potential rally to the resistance at $73,777, where bears are expected to resist. Galaxy Digital founder and CEO Mike Novogratz predicted during the company’s first-quarter earnings call that Bitcoin might consolidate between $55,000 and $75,000 before moving higher. Traders are advised to keep an eye on these key Bitcoin price levels."

This comes after a period of stagnation following the halving event. Current data suggests that the $60,000 price point has become a crucial on-chain support level, bolstered by new whale accumulation and the stability of long-term holders. CryptoQuant's latest findings reveal that new whales, defined as addresses holding over 1,000 for less than six months, have been accumulating Bitcoin around the $60,000 level. This accumulation has established this price point as a significant on-chain support level. The influx of institutional investors following the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US further supports this level. The average acquisition cost, or realized price, for these new whales is around $60,000, indicating their confidence in the market and the strength of this price level as a support for Bitcoin. In addition to the new whales, long-term whales, those who have held over 1,000 BTC for more than six months, have shown a stable realized price. This stability often reflects these investors' experienced strategies and low turnover rates, indicating a long-term accumulation approach. These holders often demonstrate strong confidence in Bitcoin's long-term value, often disregarding short-term market fluctuations. Their stable realized price serves as a benchmark for market stability and long-term support. Another factor contributing to the bullish narrative amid the market-wide recovery is the surge in the volume of stablecoins entering the market. Notable increases in stablecoin inflows have coincided with Bitcoin's price fluctuations, indicating increased liquidity in the market, which is crucial for sustaining the ongoing uptrend."

Many altcoins, including , , , and LINK, also saw double-digit gains. Last Friday, Bitcoin had retraced to just over $60,000, but the bulls defended this psychological support level over the weekend. The asset began to climb on Monday, reaching just over $63,000. However, it failed to maintain this level and retraced to $61,200 on Tuesday, ahead of the US CPI announcement for April. After the announcement, the cryptocurrency gained several thousand dollars and soared to over $66,500 for the first time since mid-April. Despite a brief retracement, the bulls attacked again in the past few days, pushing the largest digital asset to nearly $67,500. Although it has slightly retraced since then, Bitcoin still trades around $67,000. Its market capitalization stands at $1.320 trillion, and its dominance over the altcoins is at 51.7% on CG.

5/19/2024,Programmability Addition to Bitcoin Sparks Interest Among Developers,"According to Bloomberg, the recent launch of US Bitcoin has sparked interest among developers who believe that adding programmability to Bitcoin could be the solution to its intentional design flaw. Over the years, developers have attempted to rectify this flaw by building Bitcoin 'Layer 2' networks. However, the recent development of 'Arch', an application platform that runs on top of Bitcoin, has changed the game. This software could potentially allow apps from the Layer 1 Foundation to run computations similar to smart contracts on Ethereum. The Layer 1 Foundation is also developing a programmable module for the BRC-20 metaprotocol, essentially messages stored in code layered on the Bitcoin blockchain. An indexer can locate these messages and run computations. Due to Bitcoin's longer block confirmation times compared to Ethereum, there is more time to perform computations. Eril Ezerel, founder of Best in Slot and Ordinals aggregator and explorer, believes this could lead to a new chapter in crypto. However, not everyone in the Bitcoin programming community is convinced that this is the future of cryptocurrency. Some believe that the new Bitcoin L2s are expanding Bitcoin's reach, boosting the Ethereum ecosystem, and competing with it simultaneously. Despite this, new ventures are betting that this new type of programmability could lead to an influx of decentralized finance apps on Bitcoin. Currently, the total value of tokens locked in the Bitcoin DeFi market is about $1.1 billion, compared to $52.7 billion for Ethereum, according to data tracker DeFi Llama. Toby Lewis, a founder of OrdinalsBot, suggests that Bitcoin's DeFi ecosystem could grow to be the largest in all of crypto, potentially reaching trillions of dollars of market cap over the next few years. This growth could be the next catalyst that Bitcoin investors are waiting for."

Kyle Samani, a managing partner at Multicoin Capital, suggests that the Bitcoin ecosystem is experiencing a 'developer renaissance' with the advent of the Bitcoin Taproot upgrade and the Ordinals protocol. For some developers, building financial tools on Bitcoin is more appealing as it is the oldest and most secure blockchain. The Block has noted a shift in Multicoin Capital's investment trends from Solana to the Bitcoin ecosystem. The venture capital firm, which previously invested in projects like Solana Labs and StarkWare, has recently participated in funding rounds for the Bitcoin-native music platform Arch Network and the Bitcoin scaling network Mezo."

5/20/2024,"Bitcoin's Price Surges Above $67,500, New Peak Anticipated","According to CryptoPotato, Bitcoin's price has seen a weekly recovery of over 7%, briefly surpassing the $67,500 mark, a level not reached in nearly a month. The leading cryptocurrency is now aiming to establish a new peak. This recent upward price movement has established new support for Bitcoin. However, if this level is flipped, it could also become a significant resistance area. A crucial level of $61.5k has emerged, which could potentially serve as strong support for the asset. This is based on the Short-Term Holder (STH) Realized Price, a metric reflecting the realized capital of Bitcoin holders who have held their coins for a period ranging from a day to six months. This group of investors constitutes 53.48% of the total market cap, thus carrying significant weight. Within this group, CryptoQuant identified the 0-day to 1-week Bitcoin STH, which makes up 10.6% of the market and closely tracks the spot price, often without indicating significant variance. Meanwhile, the 1 week to 6 months group, accounting for 47.78% of the market, provides a more accurate reflection of short-term trader actions and sentiment. Notably, the 1-3 month holders who entered during March's rally now command more than 30% of the realized cap, indicating a substantial transfer of volume from long-term to short-term holders. According to CryptoQuant's analysis, the sensitivity of investors to the STH realized price could make $61.5k a pivotal level. If this level is decisively breached, it may flip from a support to a strong resistance. Bitcoin's price has improved since last week and is currently hovering just below $67,500 after surpassing this level over the weekend. This level has been highlighted as significant by 10x Research's latest newsletter, which suggested that a break above could lead to new all-time highs. The newsletter stated, 'Bitcoin's price action has significantly improved since last week. Prices have rebounded towards their late April resistance zone (67,500), surpassing the early May highs (64,000). A breakthrough above 67,500 could potentially lead to new all-time highs, a scenario that our Bitcoin ETF model predicts.'"
5/20/2024,Five On-Chain Indicators Suggest Cryptocurrency Bull Market Is Just Beginning,"According to Odaily, analyst 'ELI5 of TLDR' has suggested that the cryptocurrency bull market is just beginning, based on five on-chain indicators. Firstly, Bitcoin's market dominance is over 56%. Historically, the cryptocurrency bull market begins with Bitcoin's strong dominance, with most traders having sold off a large number of altcoins in the previous bear market cycle. Data from TradingView shows that Bitcoin's market dominance is slightly above 56%, and this indicator has been over 50% since October 2023. Secondly, Bitcoin's MVRV Z-Score is less than 6. According to LookIntoBitcoin charts, the Bitcoin MVRV Z-Score, which compares the current market value of an asset with its historical average, usually reaches a peak of around 6 during cycle peaks. Currently, this indicator is less than half of that, and it has not exceeded 6 since March 2021. Thirdly, the Puell Multiple has not yet exceeded 3. The Puell Multiple is another indicator consistent with cycle peaks but has not yet reached its peak. This indicator is calculated by dividing the daily value of Bitcoin produced by the annual moving average of this value. According to Coinglass data, the Puell Multiple fell below 1 after halving on April 20. Peaks over 3 usually coincide with cycle tops, reaching only 2.4 during the price increase in mid-March 2024. Fourthly, HODL data from LookIntoBitcoin is bullish for Bitcoin. The Realized Cap HODL Waves provides a macro perspective on how much Bitcoin is held by those who have recently purchased compared to earlier times. The decline in the peak of the new wave indicates that selling pressure has been exhausted, and there may be more room for growth. Lastly, Bitcoin miner revenue per hash shows how much miners profit from proof of work. Although it decreases over time with the increase in mining difficulty, ELI5 pointed out that the last two surges to $0.3/Th/s per second occurred during previous market cycle peaks."
5/20/2024,MicroStrategy's Chairman Encourages Betting On Bitcoin Amidst Price Pause,"According to U.Today, Michael Saylor, the chairman of MicroStrategy, has publicly urged the cryptocurrency community to 'bet on Bitcoin' during a period of price stagnation. This statement comes at a crucial time for Bitcoin, which is currently experiencing an unusual calm after significant price fluctuations. Saylor's unwavering confidence in Bitcoin is evident in his encouragement to invest in the digital asset despite the current price pause. Saylor has consistently advocated for Bitcoin, viewing it as a superior store of value and a hedge against inflation. Under his leadership, MicroStrategy has been a leader in corporate investment in Bitcoin. The company's aggressive acquisition strategy has resulted in a substantial Bitcoin portfolio, making it one of the largest institutional holders of the cryptocurrency. Saylor's recent 'Bet on Bitcoin' message may be a reaffirmation of his belief in Bitcoin's long-term potential. The timing of Saylor's statement is significant as it aligns with a broader market sentiment that is cautiously optimistic. On Friday, the price of Bitcoin rose above $67,000 for the first time in nearly a month, following eight weeks of sideways to lower movement. However, after this achievement, the Bitcoin price has shown little movement, failing to reach $68,000. Bitcoin was trading up 0.06% in the last 24 hours to $67,007, having reached intraday highs of $67,701. Bitcoin is still up 10% over the last seven days. As the market anticipates Bitcoin's next move, Saylor's voice serves as a bullish counterweight, encouraging crypto holders to remain steadfast in their beliefs."

He explained that if one believes that Bitcoin will become a part of the long-term tactical asset allocation strategy for institutional investors, then at some point, one must be bullish on Bitcoin. He added that many smart institutions are saying, 'Let me be bullish before it becomes part of the overall tactical asset allocation index.'

5/20/2024,Peter Schiff Declares Bitcoin Dead Despite Near Record High Trading,"According to U.Today, Peter Schiff has declared Bitcoin as 'dead', even though it is trading near its all-time high. Schiff's claim is based on Bitcoin's underperformance compared to silver since April, with growth rates of 2% and 21% respectively. He also warned that Bitcoin promoters could lose significant money by investing in the cryptocurrency. The cryptocurrency community has accused Schiff of focusing on short time frames to support his narrative. It's important to note that Bitcoin has seen a nearly 60% increase on a year-to-date basis, while silver has only risen by 14.46%. Schiff, a well-known critic of Bitcoin, has been dismissing the cryptocurrency since 2011 when it was valued at a few dollars. In a recent social media post, Schiff refuted claims that his criticism of Bitcoin is merely a ploy for attention. He argued that praising Bitcoin would have garnered more engagement, but he is unwilling to compromise his integrity for followers or increased engagement. Schiff's criticism of Bitcoin is largely driven by its promotion as a digital version of gold. He expressed concern about people being convinced to buy Bitcoin instead of gold, considering it a mistake. He stated that if Bitcoin promoters stop claiming that Bitcoin is a digital equivalent of gold, he would cease his commentary on the cryptocurrency."

The recent surge in Bitcoin's three-month annualized basis suggests a growing optimism in the market, potentially leading to increased trading activity and investment in the cryptocurrency."
5/20/2024,"Bitcoin Investors Could Generate Extra Income With Covered Strangle Strategy, Says 10x Research","According to CoinDesk, research firm 10x Research has suggested a strategy for Bitcoin investors to generate additional income from their spot market holdings. The firm recommends implementing a 'covered strangle' options strategy, which involves holding the underlying asset in the spot market while simultaneously selling out-of-the-money (OTM) call and put options tied to Bitcoin. The strategy involves selling a $100,000 strike call, which is 50% above Bitcoin's current market price, and a $50,000 strike put, both expiring in December 2024. The premium received from selling the call option, which protects the counterparty from price rallies, and selling the put option, which provides insurance against downtrends, represents the extra yield. 'Selling the call could yield 11%, and selling the put could yield 6%,' Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, said in a client note. This strategy is particularly effective when the market outlook is bullish, but the uptrend is expected to unfold slowly, keeping implied volatility or investors' expectations for price turbulence low. In such conditions, options, particularly OTM call and put options, lose value faster as expiry nears, benefiting sellers. However, the strategy is not without risks and requires a high tolerance for risk, as the risk is leveraged below the level at which the put option is sold, in this case, $50,000. 'Below the lower strike price, both the long stock and short put incur losses, and, as a result, percentage losses are twice what they would be for a covered call position [buy spot = sell OTM call] alone,' Fidelity explained in a 'covered strangle' explainer. Therefore, this strategy is recommended for those who believe Bitcoin's bull market will progress slowly and corrections, if any, will not see prices drop below $50,000. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $67,170, representing a 58% year-to-date gain."

5/20/2024,Silver Surpasses Bitcoin To Become The Eighth Largest Asset By Market Cap,"According to Odaily, recent data from Companies Marketcap reveals that the market value of silver has once again surpassed Bitcoin, making it the eighth largest asset globally. Since Bitcoin reached its historical high of $73,737 on March 14, silver has seen a 33.4% increase, while Bitcoin has experienced a 9.5% decline. The current market value of silver stands at $1.828 trillion, approximately $500 billion more than Bitcoin, which has a market value of $1.322 trillion, making it the ninth largest asset globally. This implies that Bitcoin would need to rise by 40%, reaching $93,000, to surpass the current market value of silver, assuming other factors remain constant. In addition, data from Trading Economics shows that gold has also performed well, increasing by 22.4% since February 13. Its current market value is $16.392 trillion."
5/20/2024,Chinese Businesswoman Accused Of Bitcoin Money Laundering In The UK,"According to Odaily, a Chinese businesswoman, Qian Zhimin, has been implicated in a large-scale Bitcoin money laundering case in the UK. The judicial documents reveal that the majority of the Bitcoins involved in the case are believed to have originated from her extensive fraudulent activities in China. In June 2014, Qian Zhimin opened a digital currency trading account under another person's name and used over 1.1 billion yuan of illicit funds to purchase Bitcoins. Calculated at the highest Bitcoin market value since 2024, the value has reached more than 32 billion yuan. Legal analysis suggests that Qian Zhimin fled to the UK in September 2017. On September 4 of the same year, seven departments including the Central Bank issued a 'Notice on Preventing the Risk of Token Issuance Financing'. From then on, virtual digital currency exchanges closed the exchange channel between the yuan and virtual digital currencies. This means that before the case, Qian Zhimin could directly purchase Bitcoins with illicit funds on the trading platform. Coupled with the absence of anti-money laundering measures such as real-name accounts at the time, she easily managed to flee overseas with Bitcoins."

5/21/2024,"Grayscale's GBTC Fund Records Inflow, Concerns Over Ethereum Fund Outflow Persist","According to CryptoPotato, Grayscale's GBTC fund experienced an inflow of $9.3 million on May 20. This marks a significant milestone for Grayscale, which has been losing capital since it converted the fund to a spot Bitcoin ETF in January. This is the first time since mid-January that GBTC has seen four consecutive days of inflow, with the first reversal of outflows recorded on May 3. Over the past four trading days, the total GBTC inflow was $72.5 million, as reported by Farside Investors. However, GBTC has lost 53% of its assets under management over the past four months, amounting to 330,610 , valued at approximately $23.5 billion. This has led to concerns that a similar situation could occur with its Ethereum fund if the SEC approves its conversion to a spot ETF on or before the June 23 deadline. The ETHE fund, which currently holds around $10 billion worth of ETH, is trading at a discount to net asset value of about -20%. This discount could be eliminated if the SEC approves the conversion to a spot ETH ETF. A potential exodus from this fund, similar to GBTC, could result in approximately 1.3 million ETH exiting the fund. Despite the outflow from GBTC, Bitcoin prices have rallied 70% since the approval of spot ETFs. If a similar trend occurs with ETH, the asset could potentially surge to $6,000 in the coming months. The total inflow for all spot Bitcoin ETFs on May 20 was $237.2 million. Over the past five trading days, more than $1.1 billion has been invested into ETFs. 21 Shares led the way with an inflow of $68.3 million, closely followed by BlackRock and Fidelity with $66.4 million and $64 million, respectively. The surge in ETF inflow coincides with the crypto market capitalization reaching a six-week high of $2.74 trillion on May 21, primarily driven by Ethereum."
5/21/2024,Bitcoin Price Reaches Historic High In Yen Terms,"According to Odaily, Bitcoin has reached a historic high when valued in Japanese yen. The cryptocurrency's price has soared to 11,125,31.78 yen, marking a significant milestone in its value. Over the past six months, Bitcoin has seen an impressive increase of 110.04% in its value. This surge in Bitcoin's value underscores the growing acceptance and adoption of cryptocurrencies worldwide. The rise in Bitcoin's price, particularly in yen terms, indicates a strong demand for the digital currency in Japan, a country known for its progressive stance on cryptocurrencies. However, it's important to note that while this surge represents a historic high for Bitcoin in yen terms, the cryptocurrency's value can be volatile and subject to rapid changes.

5/21/2024,MicroStrategy's Michael Saylor Hints At Potential Bitcoin Highs,"According to U.Today, Michael Saylor, the founder and chairman of business intelligence giant MicroStrategy, has once again expressed his support for Bitcoin on a social media platform. Saylor posted an AI-generated image of a human face focusing on the right eye, with the caption 'Keep your eye on the prize. #Bitcoin'. The image contained the numbers 69, 98, and 89, which some believe could be Saylor's prediction for Bitcoin's potential future value. At the time of writing, Bitcoin, the world's leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is valued at $67,240. This price level was regained by Bitcoin on Friday, and since then, the cryptocurrency has fluctuated slightly but has always managed to recover. Over the past 24 hours, Bitcoin has seen a 1.89% increase, rising from $66,000. Saylor and MicroStrategy's investment in Bitcoin, which began in August 2020, was initially considered risky by many. However, the company has since acquired 214,400 , valued at over $7.5 billion. In related news, cryptocurrency trader and analyst Ali Martinez has suggested that Bitcoin could see further gains. Martinez noted that Bitcoin has a crucial support level at $66,250, where 530,000 Bitcoins were transacted. If this support level holds, Bitcoin could potentially start to climb again."
5/21/2024,Bitwise CEO Reveals Unnamed Financial Giants Investing in Bitcoin,"According to CryptoPotato, Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley has hinted at significant financial entities investing in Bitcoin ( ), without revealing their identities. In a recent interview, Horsley discussed the rapid evolution of institutional and regulatory acceptance of Bitcoin as an investable asset, which is happening faster than most people realize. He confirmed that a certain nation's sovereign wealth fund has already ventured into Bitcoin mining. Horsley also mentioned a 'large technology company' that has invested a 'meaningful percentage' of its balance sheet into the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF, which currently holds $2.3 billion in assets under management. The company prefers to keep its investment private. Earlier this month, the public got a glimpse of which institutions were buying the Bitcoin ETFs as many high-net-worth investors disclosed their Q1 securities portfolios in mandatory 13F filings with federal regulators. Some of these included a $2 billion allocation from heavyweight hedge fund Millennium Management and a $162 million allocation from the State of Wisconsin Investment Board (SWIB). Horsley predicted that by next year, a giant tech firm like Meta may put Bitcoin on its balance sheet, thanks to the ETFs making the asset much easier to hold. He believes the next catalyst for Bitcoin's bull market will be when the public realizes 'the extent to which some of the most important, smartest organizations and lawmakers are onboard with Bitcoin.' In a memo last week, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan expressed his bullish stance on Bitcoin ETFs, given that their latest buyers still have substantial room to increase their allocations. However, he did not provide any specific details about these potential investors."

The gap between the two has narrowed down to 11,674.3418 BTC, with the market value difference also shrinking to approximately 1 billion USD (1,011,688,068.1 USD). This development indicates a significant shift in the Bitcoin ETF market, with BlackRock catching up to Grayscale's previously dominant position. The narrowing gap in holdings and market value suggests increased competition in the Bitcoin ETF sector, which could potentially impact the future dynamics of the cryptocurrency market. It's important to note that these figures are based on the most recent data available and may fluctuate due to the volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market. Investors and market watchers are advised to keep a close eye on these developments as they could signal significant shifts in the Bitcoin ETF landscape."

5/21/2024,Bitcoin Critic Warns of Negative Impact from Potential Ethereum ETF Approval,"According to CryptoPotato, Peter Schiff, a well-known critic of Bitcoin, has issued a warning about the potential negative impact on Bitcoin if the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approves spot Ethereum ETFs. This comes at a time when Bitcoin's price has surged above $70,000. Spot ETFs have been a major topic in the cryptocurrency industry this year, with the SEC approving nearly a dozen Bitcoin products in mid-January after a decade of rejecting or delaying applications. Other countries and regions like Hong Kong have followed suit, but the US remains the largest market. As a result, all eyes are on the SEC to see if another asset will receive similar approval. Ethereum, being the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, is naturally at the forefront of this trend. However, the SEC has already delayed decisions on several Ethereum ETF applications this year, and the chances of approval coming soon are slim. This changed recently when Bloomberg’s ETF experts increased their prediction approval percentages for May from 25% to 75%. This news caused the underlying asset to surge by 10% and later 20%, hitting a multi-week high of over $3,800. Bitcoin’s price also surged from under $67,000 to around $72,000 – a 6-week peak. Schiff, known for his consistent criticism of Bitcoin, suggested that the potential approval of Ethereum ETFs could be bad news for Bitcoin. He believes that any money used to buy new Ether ETFs will likely come from existing Bitcoin ETFs. Investors who have decided to allocate to crypto won’t increase that allocation to buy Ether, according to Schiff. However, it's worth noting Schiff's track record when it comes to criticizing Bitcoin. He has been issuing warnings about potential bubbles and advising investors to stay away for years, but his successful predictions are rare. For instance, less than a month ago, he used a Bitcoin correction to predict more pain for the bulls. At the time, Bitcoin had dropped to $63,000 and Schiff warned that if Bitcoin fell below $60,000, there would be a 'long way down.' Bitcoin did briefly fall below $60,000, but instead of continuing to fall, it rebounded and is now trading above $70,000."
5/21/2024,"US Market Hours Dominate Bitcoin Trading, Reaching Record High","According to Bloomberg, Bitcoin trading during US market hours has hit a record high, accounting for 46% of the cumulative volume for this year through April. This data comes from a study conducted by Kaiko Research, a cryptocurrency research firm. The study suggests that the increased share of trading could be associated with the launch of spot-Bitcoin exchange traded funds (ETFs) in January. The volume has seen a rise near the beginning and end of US trading hours. Kaiko Research points out that the ETFs calculate their net asset values each weekday at the close of US stock exchanges, which enhances price discovery and arbitrage trading. Thursdays have been identified as the day with the highest share of trading during these hours, with nearly 15% of the cumulative daily volume. Since their launch four months ago, the ETFs have drawn almost $13 billion in net inflows, marking them as one of the most successful product category debuts in the industry's history. However, the demand has recently slowed down, with only a net $925 million flowing into the funds in May. The crypto market is currently focused on the prospects for US regulators to approve or reject ETFs that invest directly in Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency. A decision by the Securities and Exchange Commission on at least one spot-Ether ETF application is expected by May 23. While Bitcoin trading volume during US hours has mostly recovered to 2022 levels, volume during Asian trading hours remains significantly lower. The performance of Bitcoin during US market hours also indicates that the cryptocurrency’s volatility is less compared to previous hours. This demonstrates the impact that these ETFs have had, not only on Bitcoin’s correlation with the S&P, but also its potential de-correlation with other altcoins and other cryptos."
5/22/2024,Stagnation in Bitcoin ATM Growth Observed in May,"According to Odaily, a report from Bitcoin News on platform X indicates a stagnation in the growth trend of Bitcoin ATMs in May.

5/22/2024,Fidelity's FBTC Sees Net Inflow of $25.8 Million,"According to Odaily, Fidelity's FBTC experienced a significant net inflow of $25.8 million yesterday. Farside Investors, a data analytics firm, reported this substantial increase in the digital asset's inflow. This surge indicates a growing interest among investors in the FBTC, which is managed by Fidelity, a renowned global financial services company. The data from Farside Investors provides a clear picture of the market dynamics and investor sentiment towards FBTC. The net inflow is calculated by subtracting the total outflows from the total inflows of the asset. A positive net inflow, as seen in this case, signifies that more money is being invested into the asset than is being withdrawn. This significant net inflow into FBTC could potentially impact its market position and value. However, it's important to note that market trends can be volatile and unpredictable. Therefore, investors should always conduct thorough research and consider various factors before making investment decisions."
5/22/2024,Bitcoin Mining Companies' Profitability Expected to Decline Post-Halving,"According to Odaily, an analysis by BlocksBridge Consulting on the financial earnings of 12 listed Bitcoin mining companies reveals that 10 of these firms have raised a total of $2 billion in equity financing activities.

Marathon Digital, CleanSpark, and Riot Platforms were the companies that raised the most funds last quarter, accounting for 73% of the total. As of the end of March, Marathon, CleanSpark, and Riot collectively held $1.33 billion in cash and over 32,200 Bitcoins. BlocksBridge Consulting predicts that financing activities may decrease in Q2 of 2024. As of May 15, investments in the primary listed Bitcoin mining company stocks were less than $500 million. Since Q2, financing activities seem to have cooled down, but this figure is already higher than the third quarter of last year."

This marked the first commercial transaction using the original cryptocurrency. Laszlo had posted a request to buy pizzas with Bitcoin five days before the actual transaction on the renowned BitcoinTalk forum. With Bitcoin's current trading value close to $70,000, the two Papa John's pizzas would now be worth over $700 million. Fourteen years ago, these pizzas were valued at just $41. The Bitcoin Pizza Index refers to the value of the Bitcoins used to buy these pizzas. The Bitcoin community celebrates Bitcoin Pizza Day on May 22 each year to commemorate this historic transaction. In 2019, Hanyecz revealed in an interview with journalist Anderson Cooper that he had also bought numerous other items with Bitcoin, spending over 100,000 in total. If he had held onto this sum instead of using it for transactions during Bitcoin's early adoption phase, he could have been one of the largest Bitcoin whales. Despite its original proponents pitching Bitcoin as a means of payment, it has struggled to gain popularity in this role. However, it has successfully established itself as a store of value, with holders anticipating price appreciation."
5/22/2024,BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF Sees 6-Week Inflow High Amid Early-Week BTC Rally,"According to Cointelegraph: BlackRock witnessed a sharp rise in inflow to its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) on May 21, totaling $290 million. This comes amidst recent upticks in Bitcoin ( ) prices, combining to the highest inflow for the BlackRock ETF since April 5. The fresh inflow into the BlackRock fund accounts for 95% of the total inflow into all U.S. ETFs on Tuesday, bringing over $300 million in total net inflow. Source: Farside Investors The latest rally saw more than $1 billion revert into Bitcoin spot ETFs over the past four trading days. Adding the recent figures, the BlackRock fund has to date attracted $16 billion in inflows since its inception, as reported by Farside Investors. However, the product's official website shows $19 billion in assets under management. Thumbnailing Grayscale's industry-leading position, BlackRock's IBIT is now close behind Grayscale's GBTC spot ETF, which holds $20 billion AUM according to the official website. On the other hand, other funds witnessed outflows. Notably, the VanEck Trust ETF reported an outflow of $5.9 million, while the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF saw a $4.2 million outflow. Meanwhile, the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund recorded a minor inflow of $25.8 million. Bitcoin's price, which achieved a six-week high of $71,600 on May 21, has been a key driver of recent ETF interest. Another factor buoying the cryptocurrency market is the potential approval of spot Ethereum ETFs in the U.S. by the Securities and Exchange Commission."
5/22/2024,Prominent Philosopher Yuval Noah Harari Criticizes Bitcoin As 'Currency Of Distrust',"According to U.Today, renowned Israeli philosopher Yuval Noah Harari, acclaimed for his best-selling book 'Sapiens', has recently criticized Bitcoin, labeling it as 'a currency of distrust'. Harari argues that even though Bitcoin supporters may have valid reasons to be skeptical of banks, their preference for the leading cryptocurrency is primarily rooted in their distrust of human institutions. He considers this an 'alarming development', as money is intended to foster trust among strangers. Harari expressed his understanding of the reasons for this distrust, but reiterated his concern about the implications. He expressed hope that humanity will find ways to establish trustworthy human institutions instead of resorting to technologies that breed distrust. Harari emphasized that humans have been able to control the world because they have learned to trust each other. He cautioned that if humans place all their trust in algorithms, these could potentially take over the world. Harari further explained the role of the financial system in creating trust. 'Farmers grow food. Shoemakers make shoes. What is the function of the financial system? Finance creates trust,' he stated. He pointed out that different financial systems are designed to foster trust among strangers, enabling them to collaborate on shared projects. Harari also noted that in the past, there was minimal trust in institutions like banks and governments, leading to money being minted from gold. This scarcity of gold limited the amount of money and consequently, economic cooperation. Today, he observed, 90% of money is merely computer data, a concept that is difficult for humans to grasp. In a previous argument against the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in finance, Harari warned that this technology could make financial regulation even more opaque for humans. He advocated for people to first understand how AI works and regulate it before integrating it into the financial system. Harari's philosophy posits that humanity is largely driven by myths that enable large-scale collective cooperation."

Balchunas made these remarks during a discussion on Space. He noted that in the case of Bitcoin spot ETFs, the SEC had contacted the applicants more than 90 days before the deadline. Therefore, if there is no communication as the deadline nears, the chances of approval naturally decrease. Previously, some politicians were very dissatisfied with the success of Bitcoin spot ETFs and wrote to SEC Chairman Gary, urging him not to repeat such actions. While the approval of Ethereum spot ETFs still needs to be discussed, there has been a 180-degree political shift, which has surprised even the staff. This is highly unusual."

5/23/2024,Bitcoin's Remarkable Journey: From Pizza Purchase to $700 Million,"According to U.Today, the global crypto community recently celebrated Pizza Day, marking not only the first real-world transaction using Bitcoin but also the cryptocurrency's significant price growth over the years. On May 22, 2010, Laszlo Hanyecz, a programmer and early Bitcoin enthusiast, made history by buying two pizzas for 10,000 BTC, a transaction then valued at around $41. Today, those 10,000 BTC would be worth nearly $700 million, demonstrating the dramatic increase in Bitcoin's value over the past 14 years. When Hanyecz made his now-famous purchase, was virtually unknown and traded for less than a cent. By 2014, Bitcoin had seen substantial growth, trading at around $400. Today, Bitcoin has not only achieved mainstream recognition but also established itself as a legitimate asset class with a market cap of over $1.38 trillion. Gabor Gurbacs, Former Director of Digital Asset Strategy at VanEck, highlighted Bitcoin's meteoric rise of more than 17,400% over the last 10 years as the celebration of Bitcoin Pizza Day got underway. '10 years ago Bitcoin traded around nearly $400 per BTC, today it’s trading around $70,000 that is a 17,400% increase,' Gurbacs noted. At the time of writing, BTC was trading at $70,133, having reached a record high of $73,750 in mid-March. Over the last decade, Bitcoin has not only survived but thrived, experiencing a growth spurt that has rarely been seen in the financial world. The celebration of Pizza Day is not just about reminiscing over pizzas bought with Bitcoins; it is a day that highlights the incredible journey of Bitcoin's value appreciation. In commemoration of the historic event, crypto exchanges and platforms posted celebratory messages on social media, acknowledging Bitcoin's evolution."
5/23/2024,"Bitcoin's Remarkable 17,400% Surge Over A Decade Raises Questions About The US Dollar","According to U.Today, Gabor Gurbacs, a strategic advisor at Tether and VanEck, has highlighted a significant concern about the U.S. dollar due to 's substantial growth over the past decade. Gurbacs used the social media platform Twitter to point out that since 2014, Bitcoin, the world's first cryptocurrency, has shown an impressive 17,400% growth, rising from $400 to the current $70,000 level. He argues that the question is not so much about what has happened to Bitcoin over this decade, but rather what has happened to the U.S. dollar, given Bitcoin's significant value increase. Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin following the 2009 mortgage market crisis to prevent a similar or more severe financial shake-up in the future. During that time, the Federal Reserve began printing money, known as quantitative easing, to bail out large banks and corporations. This practice was repeated during the banking crisis in Cyprus and again in 2020 when the pandemic began, leading to worldwide lockdowns. In 2020 alone, over $6 trillion were printed and injected into the U.S. economy, contributing to the ongoing devaluation of the U.S. dollar, as many experts have noted. The global crypto community recently celebrated Pizza Day. On this day in 2010, Florida-based software developer Laszlo Hanyecz made the first purchase of a physical object with Bitcoin, offering 10,000 BTC for two large pizzas. At the time, 10,000 Bitcoins were worth approximately $41. Today, this amount of cryptocurrency would be worth several hundred million U.S. dollars. Every year on this day, Bitcoin enthusiasts gather, purchase pizza with fiat or Bitcoin, and discuss cryptocurrency."

Scaramucci dismissed the criticism as 'complete nonsense', praising Saylor as a guide for many in the cryptocurrency community and labeling him as 'the best explainer of Bitcoin'. The majority of cryptocurrency commentators have agreed with Scaramucci, arguing that it would be absurd to view Saylor's influence as negative given his commitment to the cryptocurrency. However, some have pointed out instances where Saylor's advocacy for Bitcoin may have been excessive. In 2021, he controversially advised his followers to mortgage their homes to buy more Bitcoin at the height of a bullish cycle. This advice was criticized in 2022 during a Bitcoin price crash, with many accusing Saylor of leading them into financial disaster. Saylor defended his controversial comment, arguing that his critics had taken his words out of context. Saylor, who notably lost $6 billion in a single day during the -com bubble crash in 2000, has since reinvented himself as a leading proponent. Despite facing ridicule during the bear market, Saylor has proven his critics wrong. MicroStrategy's stock has experienced a triple-digit rally this year due to the Bitcoin rally, and Saylor's net worth has exceeded $4 billion."

The feature works by constantly taking screenshots of the user's computer screen, which are then processed by a generative AI model and the NPU to make the data searchable. Despite its potential utility, Musk compared the feature to a scenario from the 'Black Mirror' series, suggesting that it brings us closer to a dystopian future where technology controls humanity.

Short-term holder MVRV indicator. Source: James Check In his recent market report, Check asserts that retaking the $73,000 price point could catapult Bitcoin into a similar phase.

Bitcoin is up 5.22% over the past seven days. Source: CoinMarketCap He further indicated that we are still immersed in a stable, enthusiastic, but crucially non-euphoric phase of the bull. This builds a strong base for a price rally at $73,000. However, Check cautions that at this price point, short-term holders could see profits sufficient to trigger a sell-off and cause some resistance. Other analysts also contend that the market hasn't reached a state of euphoria yet. The rise to $73,000 from the current price of $69,088 means a roughly 5.6% jump, according to CoinMarketCap."
5/23/2024,"Bitcoin Nears $70,000: Analysts Monitor Key Supply Zone","According to U.Today, as hovers around the $70,000 mark, analysts are keeping a close eye on a significant supply zone for the leading cryptocurrency. This zone is vital as it signifies a primary area where a large quantity of Bitcoin was procured. Crypto analyst Ali has pinpointed a significant supply zone for Bitcoin, located between $70,180 and $70,600. Over 450,000 addresses have collectively acquired approximately 273,000 BTC in this zone. The supply zone is a crucial area on the price chart that often serves as a hurdle to upward price movements. It is the place where a substantial number of Bitcoin was previously purchased, and holders may aim to break even or take profits, potentially leading to increased selling pressure. After a steady recovery from May 1 lows of $56,500, hit highs of $71,980 on May 21 before facing resistance. At the time of writing, BTC was maintaining its declines from the previous day, down 1.91% in the last 24 hours to $69,998. As Bitcoin nears the highlighted critical supply zone, several scenarios could play out: If Bitcoin manages to break above the $70,600 level with strong volume, it could indicate a continuation of the bullish trend. This could likely attract more buyers, pushing the price higher and potentially establishing a new support level. Conversely, if Bitcoin encounters significant selling pressure within this range, it could lead to a price rejection and subsequent pullback. This scenario would suggest that many holders want to realize profits, resulting in temporary resistance. Another possibility is that consolidates below this range for a while, implying a balance between buyers and sellers ahead of a significant price movement. As Bitcoin contemplates its next move, price behavior around the $70,000 mark will be closely monitored given the large volume of BTC accumulated in this area. According to the MVRV Pricing Bands, Ali believes that if Bitcoin continues to trade above $65,125, the next local BTC peak before a temporary drop could be around $77,593."
5/23/2024,Japanese Firm Metaplanet's Bitcoin Strategy Leads to Stock Surge,"According to CryptoPotato, Metaplanet, a Japanese firm often compared to MicroStrategy on Crypto Twitter, has seen a 158% surge in its shares over the past week. This surge led to a halt in stock trading for two consecutive days. Currently, Metaplanet is leading among Japanese stocks as the highest gainer. The company's strategy, similar to that of MicroStrategy, the largest corporate holder, has been to accumulate more Bitcoin over time. This strategy has paid off, with Metaplanet's share price rising 127% to 93 Japanese yen, up from 41 at the start of the week. The company is now on the of hitting a $1 billion market cap.

Since announcing its investment strategy on April 8, Metaplanet has acquired 117.7 BTC, currently valued at $7.2 million. The company's stock surged 389% following the announcement. Metaplanet plans to use a 'full spectrum of capital market tools' to enhance its Bitcoin reserves, similar to MicroStrategy's approach. The company's Bitcoin investment strategy is a response to Japan's escalating debt burden and the rapid depreciation of the yen. Japan's debt-to-GDP ratio of 261% is the highest among developed nations, and the yen has depreciated by over 34% against the US dollar since the beginning of 2021. In contrast, Bitcoin has surged by nearly 190% against the Japanese yen in the past year. Metaplanet is currently listed exclusively on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, limiting access for U.S. investors. However, plans to tokenize Metaplanet shares on the layer-2 network Liquid have been announced by Arnab Naskar, a co-founder of the security token platform STOKR.

This change occurred at block height 844,704, timestamped 2024-05-23 14:18:50. The mining difficulty has been increased by 1.48%, reaching 84.38 T. The current average network hash rate stands at 612.18 EH/s. This adjustment in mining difficulty is a significant event in the Bitcoin network. It directly impacts the computational resources required to mine new blocks and validate transactions. The increase in difficulty suggests that more computational power is being dedicated to the network, which can be seen as a sign of increased security and robustness. The average network hash rate, which is a measure of the processing power of the Bitcoin network, is also an important factor to consider. A higher hash rate indicates a higher level of security, as it would require an immense amount of computational power to attack the network. The current average network hash rate of 612.18 EH/s further underscores the strength and security of the Bitcoin network."

Around 9 a.m. Eastern Time that day, there might be a tweet providing more explicit information about the impending approval. As the SEC had previously issued warning signals before the listing of ETFs related to cryptocurrency futures, January 2024 also clearly indicated that the Bitcoin ETF would be approved. The market was waiting for a similar 'warning' that day. However, the approval seemed to be a mere formality, as the discount of the Grayscale Ethereum Trust Fund had shrunk from -30% a week ago to only -8%. An 8% discount implies that there is at least a 90% chance of ETF approval. The trust fund, which manages assets worth $11 billion, is quite substantial and may see some investors cashing out their profits. The key question remains, when will these ETFs start trading if approved."

This could potentially indicate a growing confidence in the future value of Bitcoin, as holders are less inclined to sell even at high prices. The reduction in selling pressure is also a positive sign for the market, as it reduces the resistance that can prevent prices from rising. With less pressure to sell, there is more room for prices to increase, potentially leading to a more bullish market sentiment. This could be a positive sign for the future of Bitcoin, indicating a potential for further price increases."

5/26/2024,"The Value Of 10,000 Bitcoins Today: From Pizza Boxes To Private Jets","According to CryptoPotato, fourteen years ago, 10,000 bitcoins ( ) could only buy two pizza boxes. Today, the same amount of BTC could buy hundreds of private flights on a spaceship or even Leonardo DaVinci’s most expensive painting. This change in value is commemorated on Bitcoin Pizza Day, celebrated on May 22. The day marks a legendary moment when Floridian programmer and early BTC adopter Laszlo Hanyecz purchased two Papa John’s pizzas for 10,000 BTC in 2010. At the time, the cryptocurrency was worth $0.0041, making the purchase cost an estimated $41. Since then, bitcoin has gained more than 141,000,000%, so the stash is now worth over $690 million at the asset’s current price of around $69,000. Today, 10,000 BTC could buy at least 700 Papa John’s pizza franchises. Data from FranchiseHelp shows that the estimated initial investment required to open a standard Papa John’s pizza franchise is between $130,120 and $844,420. With $687 million, you can open more than 715 standard Papa John’s franchises. Additionally, 10,000 BTC can buy the most expensive painting of Italian polymath Leonardo DaVinci and an Airbus A380 Private Jet. DaVinci’s most expensive painting, Salvator Mundi, is worth $450.3 million, while an Airbus A380 jet is worth $600 million. Furthermore, 10,000 can buy one of the world’s most expensive diamonds, the Cullinan Diamond, which weighs 530.2 carats and is worth upwards of $400 million. With $687 million, you could easily acquire one. You could also purchase at least 250 tickets for 90-minute trips to space via Virgin Galactic’s spaceship. While a Virgin Galactic spaceship ticket costs $450,000, a private flight could cost tens of millions of dollars. With 10,000 BTC, you could produce two Hollywood blockbuster movies. Although an average Hollywood movie costs about $100 million, the most expensive films require over $300 million for production, including distribution and marketing. Interestingly, you could purchase naming rights to a stadium and 16 private islands in The Bahamas with 10,000 BTC. Depending on the terms of the deal, you could spend up to $30 million for naming rights to a standard stadium for a year, bringing a ten-year contract to $300 million, while luxury islands cost between $200,000 and $200 million."
5/26/2024,"Ancient Bitcoin Whales Resurface, Stirring Up Market Activity","According to U.Today, the Bitcoin network is experiencing a significant increase in on-chain activity due to the reemergence of ancient Bitcoin whales. These entities, which have not moved their Bitcoin holdings for over a decade, are now becoming active again. This surge in activity among these long-dormant Bitcoin addresses is a notable trend in the current market cycle, indicating an increase in the movement of old Bitcoin holdings. Julio Moreno, the head of research at CryptoQuant, stated that this current cycle has awakened more Bitcoin 's than ever before. The spending indicator for Bitcoin that is over 10 years old reached a record high of 3.7% in March, when Bitcoin was trading near $70,000. Currently, this indicator stands at 2.5%, which represents the 30-day cumulative spending annualized of Bitcoin that is more than 10 years old. This increase is not far from the record high of 3.7% observed in March, indicating the resurgence of ancient Bitcoin whales. The term 'ancient whales' refers to the earliest adopters of Bitcoin, who mined or purchased the cryptocurrency when it was in its infancy and far less valuable than it is today. Recently, an early Bitcoin miner from the Satoshi era moved 2,000 Bitcoin coins that were mined back in 2010. The reactivation of these ancient Bitcoin wallets is not just a curiosity but a significant event that could have profound implications for the market. The spending of such old coins is a rarity, and when it happens, it is closely monitored for potential impacts on market dynamics. Old Bitcoin miners and whales often act as a source of liquidity and distribution, hence the attention such moves get. The cryptocurrency community and market analysts are closely monitoring this trend. Some view the reactivation of old addresses as a natural progression as Bitcoin matures as an asset class. Others are more cautious, considering it a sign of potential market cooling or preparation for a major price move. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was up 2.86% in the last 24 hours to $69,126, extending its rebound from May 23 lows of $66,259."

He stated that spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) collectively hold around 1 million , a milestone he symbolically referred to as '1 Nakamoto'. This achievement was accomplished just over four months after the launch of Bitcoin ETFs on January 10th this year. Consequently, the volume of Bitcoin held by issuers has surpassed the 1 million BTC mark. This symbolic reference to '1 Nakamoto' is based on unverified information that Satoshi Nakamoto, the enigmatic creator of Bitcoin, possesses over 1 million BTC across numerous wallets. Although there is no precise data to confirm this, the symbolic milestone was sufficient for Saylor to term it '1 Nakamoto'. The top three Bitcoin holders among ETF issuers are BlackRock with 287,168 BTC, Fidelity with 161,538 BTC, and Invest with 48,503 BTC. MicroStrategy, under Saylor's leadership, currently holds 214,400 valued at $14.66 billion on its balance sheet, according to the most recent data. The average purchase price was $35,180, yielding a profit of 94.43%, or $7.12 billion, for Saylor and MicroStrategy. This '1 Nakamoto' milestone highlights the growing influence of Bitcoin ETFs and the increasing institutional adoption of the leading cryptocurrency. As Bitcoin continues to gain mainstream acceptance, the accumulation of BTC by ETFs and major corporations like MicroStrategy indicates a promising future for the digital asset."
5/28/2024,"Bitcoin CEO Predicts Major Price Surge, Financial Expert Advocates For Crypto Over Bonds","According to U.Today, Samson Mow, CEO of Bitcoin adoption-focused company Jan3, has predicted a significant surge in Bitcoin's value, which he believes will be driven by 'Omega candles.' Mow, a staunch Bitcoin advocate, anticipates that the cryptocurrency will eventually reach the $1 million mark. He describes 'Omega candles' as substantial green candles on Bitcoin charts, often associated with large volatility curves. Mow's prediction was shared via a tweet, accompanied by an animated GIF of a dragon breathing a pillar of green fire into the sky, symbolizing an 'Omega candle.' Mow's tweet was in response to a similar post by his former boss at Blockstream, Adam Back, who also anticipates a massive rise in Bitcoin's value in the near future. Following the launch of the spot Bitcoin ETF, Mow expressed his belief that the ETFs would trigger a Bitcoin demand shock due to substantial daily purchases. He also suggested that the mid-April halving had caused a supply shock, which would soon collide with the anticipated demand shock. In related news, financial expert and entrepreneur Robert Kiyosaki, author of the popular personal finance book 'Rich Dad Poor Dad,' has shared his views on Bitcoin. Contrary to the common belief among traditional investors that bonds are safe, Kiyosaki argues that this is a 'big lie' told to unsuspecting investors. He pointed out that even sophisticated investors often suffer losses when AAA bonds crash, typically when the commercial real estate market collapses. Kiyosaki advises investors to move towards safer assets like gold, silver, and Bitcoin before their prices skyrocket."

This count includes the accumulation by eleven spot Bitcoin ETPs launched since mid-January in the United States and twenty-one other Bitcoin ETPs offered worldwide. Source: HODL15Capital These exchange-traded products now hold about 5.08% of the current circulating supply of Bitcoin, which stands at 19,704,484 coins, according to CoinGecko. Grayscale’s GBTC remains the largest fund holding Bitcoin, with around 289,040 BTC totaling approximately $19.9 billion. However, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), with its holdings of 287,168 BTC worth around $19.8 billion, is closely tailing GBTC, and could potentially surpass it should the inflows stay steady. Grayscale has lost around 330,960 BTC, which sums up to 53% of its previous holdings, since converting GBTC into a spot ETF in mid-January. Source: HODL Capital The continuous rise of BTC within ETFs results in questions regarding the impact on self-custody growth, as evident from stagnation in BTC held in various addresses.

5/28/2024,"Robert Kiyosaki Debunks 'Bonds Are Safe' Myth, Advocates For Bitcoin","According to CryptoPotato, Robert Kiyosaki, the author of 'Rich Dad Poor Dad,' has challenged the widely accepted idea that bonds are generally safe investments. In a recent social media post, Kiyosaki referred to the belief that 'bonds are safe' as the 'biggest lie' spread by financial planners to unsuspecting investors. He further cautioned that even AAA-rated bonds are on the brink of collapse, particularly due to the impending crisis in the commercial real estate market. Instead, he recommended Bitcoin as an essential part of a secure investment strategy. Kiyosaki, a known Bitcoin advocate, argued that financial planners mislead average investors by promoting bonds as secure investments. He predicted that even AAA-rated bonds are at risk, especially in the commercial real estate sector, which he believes is on the verge of a significant downturn. According to the renowned author, this impending crash will result in substantial losses for many, including those considered 'sophisticated' investors. Kiyosaki compared bonds with what he considers safer assets like gold, silver, and Bitcoin. He suggested these will increase in value and urged investors to rethink where they place their trust and capital. Last month, Kiyosaki referred to financial analyst Harry Dent's grim prediction of an impending 'everything' crash, which he expects will severely affect the Baby Boom Generation as their home values decrease and the S&P 500 drops by 80%. also predicted that Bitcoin would fall back to $200 per coin. However, Kiyosaki saw this potential downturn as an opportunity and was excited about the prospect of acquiring Bitcoin at such a low price. He believes that those who are prepared and hold these assets will emerge as multi-millionaires or even billionaires. Kiyosaki reiterated his stance that regardless of whether Dent's predictions come true, investing in gold, silver, and Bitcoin will prove profitable in the long term while simultaneously dismissing the dollar as 'fake money.'"

5/28/2024,Laszlo Hanyecz's Role in Bitcoin's Early Development and Mining,"According to U.Today, Laszlo Hanyecz, known for his legendary pizza purchase on Bitcoin Pizza day, was not just a random IT developer who decided to use Bitcoin to buy a pizza. He was a member of Satoshi Nakamoto's original developer team and played a significant role in Bitcoin mining. Fourteen years ago, Hanyecz, a Mac developer based in Jacksonville, Florida, came across Bitcoin a year after its launch in 2010. At that time, Bitcoin only ran on Windows, so Hanyecz decided to transition it onto MacOS. He achieved this by translating the Bitcoin code and adapting it to run on Macs, writing the new version of the code on his iBook G4. Hanyecz then became one of the most trusted contributors of Satoshi Nakamoto. A thread on the X platform revealed a screenshot from the BitcoinTalk forum, where Nakamoto and Laszlo were discussing what makes Bitcoin valuable and the mechanics of how its transactions work. They also exchanged ideas and plans for the future design of Bitcoin and its scalability. However, Hanyecz did not always agree with what Satoshi suggested on the forum, often rejecting his ideas. Hanyecz was one of the first five developers who helped Satoshi to improve Bitcoin. He was also among the first developers to start mining Bitcoin. He was the very first person to ever mine with GPUs. He had a powerful gaming computer, which gave a massive boost to Bitcoin's hashpower. His computer allowed him to earn 35,000 BTC during the first two months after mining began. He quickly earned an additional 80,000 Bitcoins thanks to mining. On May 18, 2010, he posted an announcement that he would gladly buy two large pizzas and pay for them in Bitcoin, writing his name in the history of Bitcoin pop culture."
5/28/2024,"Bitcoin's Bull Market Far From Over, Predicts More Gains","According to CryptoPotato, Bitcoin recently surpassed the $70,000 mark before experiencing a correction and dropping to around $68,000. Despite this, data suggests that the bull market is far from over, and Bitcoin could be set for further gains, according to an analysis by CryptoQuant. The analysis examined the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio, a key metric in determining the state of the market. Historically, the MVRV ratio peaked at 4.83 and 3.97 in past bull markets. Currently, the MVRV ratio stands at 2.78, suggesting that Bitcoin has not yet entered the overvalued zone and could potentially see further price increases. After a period of sideways movement and adjustment lasting over two months since Bitcoin entered the overheated section in March 2024, CryptoQuant predicts a likely upward trend starting as early as June. The asset has surged by approximately 152% over the past year, with over 60% of the growth in 2024 alone driven by the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January and the recent halving event. Market participants are closely watching the Federal Reserve's prospects for rate cuts, as such actions could trigger a stock market rally. This expectation extends to Bitcoin, which behaves like a speculative asset that tends to rise when borrowing costs are low. The record high Bitcoin reached in 2021 was primarily due to ultra-low interest rates, which later reversed as the Fed began tightening its monetary policy. Galaxy CEO Mike Novogratz echoed a similar sentiment in a recent interview, discussing the impact of the recent halving and the massive adoption of ETFs on Bitcoin's price trajectory in the first quarter of the year. He added that the market's attention has shifted to the Federal Reserve's actions regarding interest rates. Novogratz also noted that until the Fed lowers short-term interest rates, Bitcoin is expected to trade within a range of $55,000 to $73,000, indicating a period of relative stability influenced by broader economic policies."

5/29/2024,Mt.Gox's Large-Scale Bitcoin Transfers Stir Market Concerns,"According to PANews, the dormant Mt.Gox addresses have started to transfer large amounts of Bitcoin, ranging from a few thousand to tens of thousands. Currently, Mt.Gox's Bitcoin inventory stands at 1.4168 million, worth nearly $10 billion. This has led to market concerns about potential selling pressure, causing Bitcoin to drop from 69400 USDT to 67500 USDT. Documents released by Mt.Gox indicate that these transfers are in preparation for the creditor repayment deadline on October 31. According to the documents, the Rehabilitation Trustee is preparing to repay the claim portion of the cryptocurrency distribution. There are two plans for the claim: Plan one is to repay and to creditors at a designated exchange, and plan two is to sell the tokens and then repay. However, as of now, the Rehabilitation Trustee has not specified which plan will be used for compensation. Earlier on April 21, a Reddit user reported that the Mt.Gox claimant found that the claim form had been updated, adding fields such as the estimated number of tokens to be retrieved, and displaying BCH and BTC codes. This indicates that Mt.Gox is moving towards paying in BTC in some way, not just committed to fiat currency payments. However, most users believe there is no connection between updating the form and paying compensation. The total amount of transferred by Mt.Gox this time is 1.4168 million, transferred to multiple addresses. Alex Thorn, Director of Research at Galaxy Digital, stated, 'I personally expect most of the Bitcoin will be held, but I can't say the same for . Not all tokens will be sold.' Regarding the selling time, Mark Karpelès, former CEO of Mt.Gox, stated on platform X, 'As far as I know, everything is normal at Mt.Gox. The trustee is transferring tokens to another wallet in preparation for possible distribution this year. Bitcoin will not be sold immediately.' The official final repayment deadline is October 31, 2024, which is still a long time away. In conclusion, Mt.Gox's token transfer action represents a potential for token selling pressure to some extent. However, even if the selling plan is chosen, it will be digested over a long period of time, making it difficult to cause a market crash directly."

Gurbacs shared his views on the global X social media network, stating that no other fiat currency can replace the USD, but Bitcoin can. He urged countries to follow El Salvador's example, which adopted Bitcoin as a reserve currency and later announced it as legal tender in 2021. Gurbacs has been a Bitcoin advocate for a decade, encouraging countries and central banks to include Bitcoin in their balance sheets to strengthen and diversify their fiat-contingent reserves. He believes that in 2024, it is irresponsible for nation states not to hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets. In related news, Argentina is considering adopting Bitcoin following El Salvador's example. The National Securities Commission (NSC) of Argentina recently initiated a meeting with El Salvador’s National Commission of Digital Assets (CNAD) to discuss potential Bitcoin adoption and regulation in Argentina. In other news, Bitcoin, the world's leading cryptocurrency, recently experienced a sudden drop of almost 4%, losing the $70,000 level it had recently reached. This happened after the Mt. Gox exchange began transferring large amounts of Bitcoin to a new wallet. The early Bitcoin trading platform has reportedly released the Bitcoin equivalent of $5.1 billion, presumably to direct these funds to the creditors who suffered after the Mt. Gox hack a decade ago. However, Bitcoin has since managed to recover 1.26% and is currently trading at $68,446."

The company, based in Colorado, has the financial capacity to do so, with no debt and over $1.3 billion in cash and bitcoin on its balance sheet. Riot is currently in the process of acquiring Bitfarms (BITF), a rival bitcoin miner, after purchasing a 9.25% stake in the company. Riot has offered to buy all outstanding shares in Bitfarms for $2.30 per share. Analysts Gautam Chhugani and Mahika Sapra note that the bitcoin mining business is becoming increasingly challenging for smaller players who lack the capital to compete in the global hash power race. The report suggests that the U.S. bitcoin mining sector is likely to consolidate to around five major players who will control a significant capacity. Currently, there are over 20 publicly listed miners. The report also highlights that smaller miners are attracting interest from AI data centers looking to purchase sites. It suggests that the largest bitcoin miners should increase their M&A activities to maintain long-term strategic relevance. The authors of the report see bitcoin miners as a strategic asset controlling power, land, and significant operating capabilities in running data centers, especially if power becomes the biggest constraint to scale up artificial intelligence computation. Bernstein, the broker, has given an outperform rating on Riot shares with a $22 price target. At the time of the report, the shares were trading around $10.30."

Despite these fluctuations, the cryptocurrency has now stabilized at around $68,000. This volatility followed news of the US Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) impending approval of spot Ethereum ETFs, which led to a surge in Bitcoin's value to nearly $72,000. However, the price fell to under $66,500 just hours before the SEC's actual approval.

For the first time since December 2023, long-term holders have begun to accumulate Bitcoin again. Analysts pointed out that in the past week, the selling pressure of long-term holders has significantly cooled down, and investors have returned to the accumulation mode. This indicates that volatility is a necessary condition for triggering a new round of selling. The report also pointed out market indicators showing that buyer demand is rebounding. For instance, last week, the US-based spot Bitcoin ETF had a net inflow of $242 million per day. The analyst added, 'Considering the selling pressure of $32 million naturally generated by miners every day since the halving, the buying pressure of the ETF is almost eight times that, which highlights the size and scale of the ETF's influence.' It is worth noting that Glassnode observed that the price trend of Bitcoin in the past three months has been more moderate than the previous bull market cycle. According to Glassnode's data, in the past three months, Bitcoin has only recorded weekly, monthly, and quarterly increases of more than 3.3%, 7.4%, and 25.6% on five days in the past 90 days."

5/29/2024,"Bitcoin Tests $72,000 Resistance Level Thrice, Sparks Speculation of New Highs","According to U.Today, Bitcoin ( ) has recently tested the significant $72,000 resistance level three times, leading to increased market speculation about the potential for a new all-time high if this resistance can be decisively broken. The $72,000 mark has become a critical point for Bitcoin, representing a level of resistance that has been challenging to surpass. This resistance level has emerged as a significant psychological and technical barrier for traders and investors. Each of the three tests of this level was met with strong selling pressure, preventing BTC from making a sustained move higher. However, if Bitcoin manages to break above this level, it could trigger a short squeeze, potentially catapulting the currency to a new all-time high of $75,000. Market analysts and traders are closely monitoring Bitcoin's price behavior at this resistance level. The repeated tests suggest building momentum that could potentially lead to a breakout. Historically, such persistence often precedes significant price movements, as resistance levels tend to weaken with each successive test. Glassnode cofounders, known as Negentropic, highlight the significance of testing the $72,000 resistance level thrice. They note that a confirmed break above this key level could push BTC to a new all-time high of $75,000. According to Negentropic, the $72,000-$74,000 range is marked by high supply and selling pressure. A sudden breach here could trigger a short squeeze, propelling BTC to unprecedented heights. In the short term, the chances for Bitcoin range trading remain, with prices expected to range between $64,000 and $72,000. This consolidation phase might give altcoins a chance to shine. At the time of writing, BTC was down 0.60% in the last 24 hours to $68,191 after dipping to lows of $67,437."

The wallet contained 43.6 Bitcoins, which are currently valued at approximately $2.96 million. The man, named Michael, established a cryptocurrency wallet at some point in 2013 and used RoboForm to create a unique password.

However, when the encrypted file was damaged, Michael no longer had access to the 20-character password required to access the 43.6 Bitcoins in his wallet. Although Michael could not recall exactly when he created his password, the researchers noted that he transferred Bitcoins into his wallet on April 13, 2013. They used specific time parameters and tested numerous passwords until they found the correct one, which was created on May 15, 2013. As a token of gratitude, Michael transferred a portion of the Bitcoins to the two researchers. He also sold a small portion, leaving him with 30 Bitcoins, valued at approximately $2 million. Michael has stated that he plans to hold onto his Bitcoins until the value of a single token reaches $100,000."

Since then, creditors have been anticipating the repayment of their assets, which is expected to increase selling pressure on Bitcoin markets. Mt. Gox owes over $9.4 billion worth of Bitcoin to some of its 127,000 creditors, with a final repayment deadline of Oct. 31, 2024. In January, the trustee began contacting creditors to verify their identities and arrange accounts for repayment. As the Bitcoin community deals with these developments, the overarching theme is one of change — both disruptive and transformative. Saylor's message signifies resilience in the face of uncertainty brought about by the ongoing Mt. Gox situation. His statement may also be an affirmation that, despite market uncertainty, the belief in Bitcoin's transformative potential remains a guiding light for many."
5/29/2024,"Bitcoin's Seven-Day Hashrate Reaches Record High, Intensifying Mining Competition","According to CryptoPotato, Luxor Technology’s HashRateIndex reported on May 29 that Bitcoin’s seven-day hashrate reached a record high of 659 exahashes per second (EH/s). This marks a 13.6% increase from its post-halving low of 580 EH/s. Additionally, the average network hashrate reached a record high of 732 EH/s over the weekend, as per Bitinfocharts. This increase in network power signifies a more challenging environment for Bitcoin miners as each block becomes more difficult and competitive to mine. However, high hashrates also imply enhanced network security for the Bitcoin blockchain. HashRateIndex suggested that the hashrate growth could be a sign that public Bitcoin miners are activating their ASIC orders as planned. This implies that more potent hardware is being utilized, intensifying the competition as more hash power becomes available. The current average block time is a rapid 9 minutes and 26 seconds. The top public miners have had 76.6 EH/s worth of equipment on order for 2024. Of this, 12.9 EH/s should have been delivered in Q1, and nearly 36 EH/s should have been delivered in Q2. The platform also predicted that the current surge in hashrate will result in a significant upward difficulty adjustment in about 8 days. The difficulty adjustment is estimated to be +5.97%. Difficulty is a measure of competitiveness among miners on the network. It is currently 84.38T after falling from a record high of 88.1T earlier this month. Another upward adjustment will mean more challenges for miners. Hashprice, a measure of how much a miner can expect to earn from a specific quantity of hash rate, is currently just $53 per petahash per second per day and has fallen 46% since the beginning of the year. Hashprices peaked at $400/PH/s/day during the crypto market cycle peak in 2021 but have dropped 87% as mining profits decrease amid increasing competition, energy and hardware costs, and network hashrates. This has led large mining companies to seek out cheaper energy in countries in Africa and Scandinavia."
5/30/2024,Bitcoin's Renaissance: A Shift Back from Ethereum and Other Blockchains,"According to Bloomberg, the recent fundraise by crypto venture capital firm indicates a renewed interest in -focused projects. This shift is seen as a move away from and other blockchains, which are traditionally easier to run software such as decentralized finance applications. The success of Ordinals, a type of nonfungible tokens now on the oldest blockchain, has spurred increased interest in building within the Bitcoin ecosystem. ""Bitcoin is undergoing a renaissance with a new wave of projects building on it,"" said Tse in an interview. Over the years, the developer community had shifted away from Bitcoin to new chains, but recently, attention has returned to Bitcoin for multiple reasons. This interest was further fueled by the approval and launch of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the US earlier this year, as well as the Bitcoin 'halving' event in April, which reduced the mining reward by half. Babylon, a new project, aims to enable as a 'staking' asset to secure other blockchains. Staking, a mechanism that runs and other proof-of-stake blockchains, involves locking up deposits of cryptocurrency to validate transactions and secure the network in exchange for rewards. Unlike Ethereum, Bitcoin is a proof-of-work blockchain that involves miners solving complex puzzles to validate transactions. Babylon's goal is to allow Bitcoin holders to participate in validating transactions on proof-of-stake networks, while earning yields on their otherwise idle Bitcoin. ""Our project is analogous to Ethereum’s staking, but for Bitcoin,"" Tse explained. For Babylon and its investors, the incentive to make Bitcoin a staking asset is significant, as many Bitcoin holders have long wanted to generate yield from their Bitcoin. Returns are generated elsewhere in the digital-asset sector, especially after Ethereum completed a key revamp of its network called the Merge, transforming the blockchain to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake setup. Tse emphasized the importance of security in the crypto Web3, advocating that , being a large asset, can underwrite the security layer for the entire Web3 ecosystem. Staking is one of the most lucrative corners of the digital-asset sector. Among the top three projects in decentralized finance by total value of cryptocurrencies sent to the platform, two of them, Lido Finance and EigenLayer, fall under the staking category. Users have sent more than $50 billion in crypto combined to the two projects, partly to generate returns, according to data tracker DefiLlama."

5/30/2024,Financial Commentator Peter Schiff's Satirical Take On Bitcoin Investment,"According to U.Today, Peter Schiff, a financial commentator known for his skepticism towards Bitcoin, recently shared a series of social media posts that combined sarcasm with financial speculation. Schiff proposed a hypothetical situation in which all publicly traded U.S. companies would liquidate their assets, halt operations, and invest all proceeds in Bitcoin. He suggested that such a move would cause each Bitcoin to be worth millions, significantly increasing the market capitalization of U.S. stocks and making everyone wealthy. Schiff continued his satirical narrative by discussing his own investments, particularly in U.S. oil stocks. He hinted that if these companies also converted their assets to Bitcoin, their stock values would soar, making investors like him richer. However, he highlighted the irony of this scenario, pointing out that while everyone would theoretically be rich, there would be no actual goods or services left. Schiff's comments are a direct jab at Bitcoin enthusiasts, often known as maximalists, who believe that Bitcoin is destined for unlimited growth and will become the future cornerstone of global finance and a societal model. Schiff, on the other hand, has consistently criticized Bitcoin, labeling it as a bubble and a scam without intrinsic value. Despite Schiff's criticism, Bitcoin's price continues to hover around $68,000 per coin. At the beginning of the day, Bitcoin's price saw a drop of over 1.5%. The cryptocurrency is still within reach of its all-time high of $74,000, falling short of this peak by 9%."
5/30/2024,"Bitcoin's Future Price Could Reach $1 Million, Predicts Industry Expert","According to U.Today, Samson Mow, a prominent figure in the cryptocurrency industry and CEO of JAN3, has predicted that Bitcoin's price could eventually reach $1 million. Mow, known for his bullish stance on Bitcoin, believes that the question is not if, but when Bitcoin will hit this milestone. He frequently shares his optimistic views on social media. Mow's company, JAN3, is dedicated to accelerating Bitcoin adoption through infrastructure development and financial services. His predictions are based on the current supply and demand dynamics of Bitcoin, emphasizing that the demand for the cryptocurrency far exceeds its available supply. One of the key factors Mow highlights is the role of spot Bitcoin ETFs. These financial instruments allow investors to access Bitcoin without directly owning the asset through traditional markets. Current data shows that Bitcoin ETFs hold more than one million Bitcoin, approximately 5% of the total circulating supply. Mow also points to the substantial inflow of Bitcoin into exchanges as another indicator of robust demand. Even if his main theory does not prove to be accurate, Mow notes the importance of the 'Veblen effect' in the case of Bitcoin. The Veblen effect is a phenomenon where the demand for a commodity increases as its price increases, contrary to standard economic theory. This effect suggests that rising prices can spark interest and investment in Bitcoin. At present, the price of Bitcoin is around $68,000, a slight decline of more than 0.6% since the beginning of the day. Despite this decline, the cryptocurrency is still close to its all-time high of $74,000."

This comes at a time when the market widely anticipates disappointing inflation data on May 15.

Recently, he used his X (previously known as Twitter) account to discuss the newly approved spot Ethereum ETFs and criticize them. Mow, like other Bitcoin maximalists, refers to altcoins as 's-coins', indicating their disapproval. He commented on the recent approval of spot Ethereum ETFs, stating that 's-coins do not help Bitcoin' and that there is 'no second best' for him. Mow believes that there is currently no demand for spot Ethereum ETFs, which he refers to as 'securitized ETH', and that Bitcoin enthusiasts will not revise their models due to these ETFs. He recently tweeted that it was investors' 'last chance to sell ETH above 0.05 BTC.' Mow's stance on Ethereum ETFs not aiding Bitcoin appears to contradict the views of Bitcoin evangelist and MicroStrategy founder Michael Saylor. In a recent interview, Saylor, whose company purchases Bitcoin monthly and adds it to its balance sheet, suggested that the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs could be beneficial for Bitcoin. He reasoned that the SEC's positive decision on Ethereum expands the entire asset class, potentially attracting more investment into Bitcoin.

5/31/2024,Vitalik Shares Thoughts on Bitcoin Block Size Debate,"According to PANews, after reading two books on the block size debate of the 2010s, 'The Blocksize War' and 'Hijacking Bitcoin', Vitalik has shared his thoughts on the matter. He stated that when personally experiencing the Bitcoin block size debate, individuals often side with the big block camp, with sympathy for the big block side mainly focusing on several key points: Bitcoin's initial key promise was digital cash, and high fees could potentially kill this use case. While Layer2 protocols can theoretically offer much lower fees, the whole concept has not been sufficiently tested, and the small block camp's promise of a small block roadmap is very irresponsible, as they know very little about the performance of the Lightning Network in practice. Today, practical experience with the Lightning Network has made pessimistic views more common. Vitalik does not believe in the 'meta-level' story of the small block camp. Small block supporters often argue that ' should be controlled by users', 'users do not support big blocks', but they are never willing to determine any specific way to define who are 'users' or measure what they want. Big block supporters have secretly tried to propose at least three different ways of counting users: hash power, public statements from well-known companies, and social media discourse, with small block supporters condemning each method. The big block supporters organized the New York Agreement not because they liked 'conspiracy groups'; they organized the New York Agreement because the small block supporters insisted that any controversial changes required 'consensus' among 'users', and a statement signed by major stakeholders was the only feasible method that the big block supporters believed could truly achieve this. The Segregated Witness proposal put forward by the small block camp aims to slightly increase the block size, which is overly complicated and unnecessary compared to a simple hard fork block size increase. The small block camp ultimately adheres to the idea of 'soft forks good, hard forks bad' (which Vitalik strongly opposes), and designed a method to increase the block size to accommodate this rule, even though Bier admits that the complexity has greatly increased to the point where many big block camps cannot understand the plan. In the end, the big block camp also abandoned 'clean and simple', and instead adopted ideas such as Bitcoin Unlimited's adaptive block size increase, which Bier (rightly) heavily criticized. The small block camp is indeed conducting very inappropriate social media censorship to impose their views, which ultimately led to Theymos's infamous statement 'If 90% of /r/ users think these policies are intolerable, then I hope these 90% of /r/Bitcoin users leave.'"

In a recent social media post, he emphasized a crucial piece of advice for digital asset enthusiasts. In cryptocurrency terminology, a 'sat' refers to a satoshi, the smallest unit of Bitcoin, named after its enigmatic creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. Therefore, 1 BTC equals 100 million satoshis. The phrase 'stack ' has gained popularity among Bitcoin supporters, promoting consistent accumulation over time, irrespective of price fluctuations.

MicroStrategy has frequently made news for its significant investments in Bitcoin, and Saylor's persistent advocacy has established him as a prominent voice in the crypto space.

'It's fascinating to consider that if Satoshi is still alive, he is almost certainly aware of $DOG and the new memecoin trend on his chain,' Leonidas stated on a social media platform. Runes Protocol, a new token standard that allows the issuance of fungible tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain, was launched after Bitcoin's halving. The protocol was developed by Casey Rodarmor, the developer behind the much-discussed Bitcoin Ordinals. The protocol functions as an additional layer on top of the main chain and operates within Bitcoin's existing infrastructure. Following the launch of Runes Protocol, Bitcoin saw a significant increase in fees. On April 20, it generated 24 times more fees than . However, this spike in fees was short-lived. The protocol's momentum waned in a relatively short period, and fees quickly returned to normal. After the initial excitement faded, the protocol is once again in the spotlight due to the popularity of coins. The Bitcoin-based DOG•GO•TO•THE•MOON (DOG) meme coin has seen a nearly 24% increase in the past 24 hours. It is now nearing the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap, with its valuation almost reaching $800 million."

5/31/2024,Presidential Candidate Robert Kennedy Believes Bitcoin Can Fulfill Promises,"According to Odaily, US Presidential candidate Robert Kennedy has made a bold statement regarding . He believes that over the past century, all wars have been triggered by fiat currency, and Bitcoin could be the solution to this issue. Kennedy suggests that Bitcoin has the potential to 'fulfill our promises'. Kennedy's comments highlight the potential of Bitcoin as a global currency, free from the control of any government or institution. This decentralization could potentially prevent conflicts caused by the manipulation of fiat currencies. The candidate's statement underscores the growing recognition of Bitcoin's potential in the political sphere. However, it's important to note that while Kennedy's views are certainly thought-provoking, they represent one perspective in a much larger conversation about the role of cryptocurrencies in our society. As the 2024 Presidential race continues, it will be interesting to see how the discussion around and other cryptocurrencies evolves."

5/31/2024,US Spot Bitcoin ETFs Witness Longest Inflow Streak Since February,"According to CryptoPotato, the US spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) market has seen a continuous inflow streak, last observed in February. Data from Farside Investors shows that since May 13, 2024, spot Bitcoin ETFs have been on a 13-day inflow streak. This trend reflects investors' faith in Bitcoin's potential and a steady capital inflow into the ecosystem, despite Bitcoin's failure to hit a new all-time high. The US spot Bitcoin ETFs were launched on January 11, and two trading days post their listing, the funds collectively experienced outflows exceeding $52 million. This was due to investors transferring their assets from Grayscale's GBTC in large numbers. The nine newly launched ETFs saw significant or no inflows in the first ten days of their existence, with the outflows from GBTC surpassing their inflow streak. However, the situation changed in late January when the inflows of the new ETFs overshadowed GBTC's outflows. This trend continued until mid-February, resulting in a 17-day inflow streak that brought billions into the ETFs. Despite the inflow streak breaking in February, the ETFs recorded more inflows than outflows until reached its all-time high of $73,700 in mid-March. After this, investors began to take profits, and inflows slightly decreased. April saw more outflow days than inflows for the ETFs, coinciding with a downturn in the broader crypto market as investors continued to realize their profits. This negative trend continued into May, with the first day of the month seeing all the US spot Bitcoin ETFs experiencing collective outflows exceeding $563 million. However, since the ETF downturn on May 1, the investment vehicles saw four more days of outflows until May 13. Since then, the US spot Bitcoin ETF market has been on a 13-day inflow streak, despite occasional outflows from individual funds. For instance, Ark Invest's ARKB saw outflows of approximately $100 million, but inflows into the other funds outpaced it, netting $48.8 million. So far, May has been a positive month for the spot Bitcoin ETF market. Three days ago, BlackRock's IBIT became the world's leading ETF by assets under management, surpassing GBTC. Furthermore, the global spot Bitcoin ETF market now holds more than one million BTC."
5/31/2024,Bitcoin Stagnates Despite $2B in Spot ETF Inflows amid Mt. Gox Movements and Regulatory Actions,"According to Coinetelegraph: Despite a $1.96 billion inflow into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs since mid-May, Bitcoin's price point remains relatively stagnant, puzzling many investors. The cause of this lack of bullish momentum despite such strong ETF activity may lie in a combination of factors – from Mt. Gox coin movements to regulatory actions. Aggregate Bitcoin balances on exchanges, BTC. Source: Glassnode The recent movement of 141,686 BTC by the bankrupt exchange Mt. Gox could indicate imminent asset distribution to its creditors, possibly exerting selling pressure on the market. On the regulatory front, legal actions against prominent exchanges and intermediaries like Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, KuCoin, and Robinhood by U.S. regulators such as the SEC and the CFTC have contributed to the industry’s uncertainty. This might have diminished Bitcoin’s allure to institutional investors. Increasing anti-crypto sentiment among U.S. politicians, like Senators Elizabeth Warren and William Cassidy, has also clouded the crypto industry’s image further. Although these factors could explain the disappointing response to the inflow into spot Bitcoin ETFs, the long-term implications for Bitcoin prices remain unclear. With the U.S.'s continuing debt crisis, it would be interesting to see if spot ETF investors maintain their positions."
5/31/2024,"Bitcoin ETF Attracts Over 500 Financial Advisory Institutions, Claims Analyst","According to Odaily, a recent article by CNBC stating that ETFs have failed to win the hearts of financial advisory institutions has been refuted by Bloomberg's senior ETF analyst, Eric Balchunas. Balchunas countered the claim on platform X, stating that in just the first few months following the launch of the Bitcoin ETF, over 500 financial advisory institutions have made purchases. Furthermore, he pointed out that the Bitcoin ETF has generated more returns than most ETFs have in their entire market lifespan. This contradicts the CNBC article's assertion that Bitcoin ETFs have not been successful in attracting investment from financial advisory institutions. Balchunas' analysis suggests that Bitcoin ETFs have not only attracted significant interest but have also delivered substantial returns."
5/31/2024,Bitcoin's Price Consolidation May Lead to New Rally,"According to CryptoPotato, 's price has been in a consolidation phase for nearly three months after reaching a new all-time high of approximately $74K. Despite not achieving a new peak since then, a fresh rally could be on the horizon. Bitcoin's daily price action has been erratic, with the market consolidating within a descending channel. Currently, the asset is testing the upper boundary of this channel and the $68K level. Although it has not yet broken through to the upside, the momentum remains bullish, suggesting a breakout could occur at any time. If this happens, the market could rise towards the $75K all-time high and potentially set a new record. The 4-hour chart provides a clearer view of the recent consolidation, with the price fluctuating around the $68K level in a symmetrical triangle pattern. Given the price action within this pattern and the fact that the market has touched the lower trendline of the triangle three times, a bullish breakout seems likely based on traditional price action principles. However, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains around the 50% level, failing to indicate a potential short-term direction. Therefore, the direction of a breakout from the triangle will be crucial. As 's price gradually moves towards a new all-time high, investor is also increasing. The exchange reserve metric, which measures the total amount of Bitcoin held in exchange wallets, has been steadily declining since February. This reduction in supply has been a contributing factor to the recent rally. The decline has become even more pronounced in recent days, as investors anticipate a rally towards a new all-time high. This decrease in exchange reserve could be just what the market needs to rally."

6/1/2024,MicroStrategy's Michael Saylor Celebrates Four Years in Bitcoin,"According to U.Today, Michael Saylor, the founder and executive chairman of MicroStrategy, recently celebrated his four-year anniversary of his first purchase. In 2020, Saylor made his initial investment in the world's leading cryptocurrency. Later that year, in August, MicroStrategy, a business intelligence giant, made its first Bitcoin purchase using the company's spare cash. The Bitcoin was then added to the company's balance sheet. Since then, the company has regularly reported its Bitcoin purchases, a practice known as 'stacking ' among Bitcoin enthusiasts. A 'sat' refers to the smallest unit of Bitcoin, the Satoshi, named after the cryptocurrency's elusive creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. One Bitcoin is equivalent to 100 million Satoshis. As of the first quarter of 2024, MicroStrategy holds 214,400 BTC, valued at $7.538 billion USD. In a recent appearance on the 'What Bitcoin did' podcast, Saylor surprised the Bitcoin community by suggesting that the recent approval of spot ETFs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could be beneficial for Bitcoin. He argued that this could solidify the cryptocurrency industry's standing in Wall Street's eyes and potentially lead to increased investment in Bitcoin. This could accelerate institutional adoption of Bitcoin and expedite purchases of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, which the SEC permitted earlier this year. However, not all Bitcoin maximalists agree with Saylor's viewpoint. Samson Mow, CEO of Jan3, recently tweeted that 's-coins do not help Bitcoin' and that Bitcoin does not need them, seemingly in response to Saylor's statement. Mow argued that there is no demand for 'securitised ETH' and that the approval of the spot ETF does not alter his overall bearish outlook on Ethereum, the second largest cryptocurrency. Prior to the approval of the Ethereum ETFs, Mow urged the crypto community to sell their Ethereum and invest more in Bitcoin."

6/1/2024,"MicroStrategy's Share Price Could Skyrocket Due to Bitcoin Commitment, Says Analyst","According to U.Today, financial analyst Henrik Zeberg has recently suggested that business analytics firm MicroStrategy could experience a significant surge in value. This prediction is based on the company's unwavering commitment to , with its entire business strategy revolving around the digital asset. Zeberg believes that the current 'Super Euphoria' in the crypto market, largely driven by Bitcoin, could propel MicroStrategy's share price to unprecedented levels. MicroStrategy's recent success, with its share price already surpassing levels seen in 2021, lends credence to Zeberg's prediction. He further points to the Elliott Wave structure and Fibonacci analysis, which indicate a potential target well above previous all-time highs dating back to 2000. If Zeberg's projections hold true, MicroStrategy's stock could increase by a substantial $240, reaching as high as $3,560. MicroStrategy's CEO, Michael Saylor, a known advocate, has been under close observation in light of these predictions. Nasdaq data reveals that Saylor sold a significant amount of MSTR stock in April, sparking investor curiosity. However, the selling abruptly ceased at the end of the month, leading to speculation about Saylor's confidence in Zeberg's predictions and the future of the company. A key factor in MicroStrategy's potential rise is its substantial Bitcoin holdings, currently valued at $14.66 billion. With an average purchase price of $35,180 per BTC, the company stands to make significant profits, amounting to an impressive 94.43% gain, or $7.12 billion."

6/2/2024,Cybersecurity Researchers Assist in Recovery of Lost Bitcoins,"According to CryptoPotato, two cybersecurity researchers have successfully aided an anonymous cryptocurrency user in recovering 43.6 bitcoins ( ) that were lost 11 years ago due to lost access to the wallet containing the assets. The researchers, Joe Grand and Bruno, managed to reverse engineer the password generator that was used to create the password for the wallet, despite the rigorous process involved. The anonymous user, referred to as Michael, informed Grand and Bruno that he had set up the wallet in 2013, using RoboForm to generate a unique password. For security purposes, he chose to store the password in an encrypted file rather than on RoboForm. Unfortunately, the encrypted file became corrupted, resulting in Michael losing access to his wallet. Michael initially reached out to Grand in 2022 but was turned down. However, he persisted and contacted Grand again in June 2023, successfully gaining his attention and starting the process of asset retrieval. The researchers discovered a vulnerability in RoboForm's random number generator, which linked each generated password to the date and time it was created on a user's computer. Although this bug was fixed in 2015, Grand and Bruno believed it would have affected all passwords created prior to that. Michael was asked to recall the date he created the password. Despite the challenge, the researchers found out that he transferred the bitcoins into his wallet on April 13, 2013. They used time parameters and tested hundreds of passwords until they found the correct one, created on May 15, 2013. After finding the correct password, they accessed the wallet and retrieved the bitcoins. Michael rewarded Grand and Bruno with a portion of the recovered bitcoins when the value of was around $38,000. When the value of the asset rose to $62,000, he sold some for himself. Currently, Michael holds 30 BTC, worth approximately $2 million, and plans to retain them until the asset's value reaches $100,000."

The cryptocurrency, which is the largest by market capitalization, lost its $68,000 price level overnight. Saylor used an AI-generated image of a physical Bitcoin and bees in a tweet, stating, 'Bitcoin is a Swarm of Hornets.'

Since September 2021, has been recognized as the official legal tender in the South American nation. In his first term, Bukele reaffirmed his commitment to buying one Bitcoin daily into a cold wallet until it can no longer be technically obtained. Max Keiser, a prominent Bitcoin supporter and advisor to the President, has proposed an ambitious plan for El Salvador during Bukele's second term. Keiser believes that the country's wealth will increasingly be controlled by its citizens through decentralized Bitcoin nodes. In this model, the President will propose initiatives that the public can fund through crowd-sourcing, effectively reinventing the social contract and operating the nation on a circular Bitcoin-focused economy. Keiser also envisions El Salvador becoming debt-free and utilizing its geothermal and volcanic energy to power mining, with the goal of controlling 10% of the global hash rate. The country has already made significant strides in this direction, using geothermal energy from the Tecapa volcano to mine 473.5 Bitcoin, valued at approximately $29 million. Of the 102 MW produced by the country's power plants, 1.5 MW is allocated to Bitcoin mining. According to data from , El Salvador currently holds 5,718 Bitcoin, valued at roughly $400.26 million. Keiser believes this innovative approach will diminish the influence of central banks and render international financial institutions like the IMF irrelevant in the country's economic policies."
6/3/2024,10x Research: Bitcoin Exchange Balances Plummet as Traders Show Concern Over Market Trend,"According to ChainCatcher: traders are expressing their concerns over the current market trend of Bitcoin. Despite Bitcoin's price being only 7% shy of its all-time peak, the upbeat tempo isn't improving. A significant number of Bitcoins are being pulled from trading platforms, indicating a potential shift in market sentiments. The cryptocurrency market volume has plummeted to $50 billion, and funding rates are hardly positive. The Federal Reserve policy and inflation data are considered the two main determinants that could propel Bitcoin to record new all-time highs. The Bank of Canada's potential rate cut, expected on June 5, may set a precedent for the Federal Reserve, while the U.S. inflation data to be released on June 12 could instigate a rise in Bitcoin if lower than the 3.3% forecast. The considerable decline in Bitcoin exchange balances could be interpreted as a move by large-scale Bitcoin holders or 'whales' offloading their coins from exchanges in expectation of a price surge. Over the last month, 88,000 Bitcoins have been shifted off exchanges, leaving a residue of 2.5 million Bitcoins, the lowest since March 2018. These outflows began on May 15, 45 days after the quarterly 13F filing deadline for U.S. registered investors supervising over $100 million. "
6/3/2024,Veteran Trader Peter Brandt Highlights Bitcoin's Potential Amid Fiat Currency Decline,"According to U.Today, Peter Brandt, a seasoned trader recognized for his sharp market insights, has recently presented a persuasive case for , emphasizing the potential downfall of fiat currencies. Brandt's analysis uses historical comparisons and technical patterns to underscore Bitcoin's increasing importance in the global financial arena.

He shared a chart comparing Bitcoin (BTC) to the total U.S. money stock (M1), a ratio he claims is still below the high of December 2017. Brandt draws attention to the striking similarities between this chart and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) during the Great Stagflation of the 1970s. The 1970s were characterized by high inflation and stagnant economic growth, a condition known as stagflation. Brandt believes that the pattern exhibited by the DJIA during this period is now reflected in Bitcoin's performance against the growing supply of U.S. dollars. This pattern, known as an inverted head and shoulders, is often seen as a bullish signal, indicating further upward movement in Bitcoin's value. The inverted head and shoulders pattern is a technical analysis chart formation that signals a reversal of a downward trend. It consists of three parts: a low point (head) flanked by two higher low points (shoulders). When this pattern forms, it signals the potential for a significant upward price movement once the price breaks above the resistance level formed by the shoulders. In the context of , this pattern suggests an impending momentum shift that could drive the cryptocurrency to new heights, much like the Dow eventually emerged from the stagflation period. Brandt's perspective is not without skepticism, as he acknowledges that some market observers may dispute the definition of the pattern as a 'continuation inverted head and shoulders.' Therefore, he presents an argument with numerous references to support his claims. If the identified inverted head and shoulders pattern is confirmed, it could be the technical affirmation of a much larger fundamental shift — one that could redefine the very concept of money in the coming years. At the time of writing, BTC was trading at $67,722."

6/3/2024,Wisconsin Investment Board's Bitcoin ETFs Investment Seen as Trial Phase,"According to CoinDesk, the State of Wisconsin Investment Board's (SWIB) investment into spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) earlier this year is likely just a trial phase, according to David Krause, a professor of finance at Milwaukee-based Marquette University. Krause stated that the board has always been innovative and it's no surprise that it's experimenting with bitcoin. In the first quarter, the SWIB added two spot bitcoin ETFs to the portfolio of Wisconsin's pension plan. The board purchased shares of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) valued at $164 million as of March 31, as revealed in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in May. This move surprised the industry as big institutions, particularly pensions, don’t usually invest in young ETFs like the spot bitcoin ETFs. However, Krause noted that the state’s investment board has been ahead of the game before. Krause further explained that the SWIB is a fully funded pension fund, which gives it the luxury of being able to invest for the long term without worrying as much about liquidity. As of the end of 2023, the SWIB managed roughly $156 billion in assets, meaning its holdings in the ETFs were a negligible roughly 0.1% of its portfolio. Krause believes that the investment was just a “toe in the water” and he expects the SWIB to add to that amount and for other pensions to eventually follow suit. He said, 'I think it’s just an entry point. I think they’re testing to see the reaction of the public to whether or not there’s resistance to owning this and they’re using it as a trial run, because it really is not going to impact the portfolio substantially, until you get to maybe a 1% or 2% positioning.' In the first three months of the year, nearly 500 institutional investors revealed allocations into the spot ETFs. The biggest owner as of March 31 was hedge fund Millennium Management, which revealed $2 billion in holdings across a number of the funds, or roughly 3% of its total assets under management."
6/3/2024,Wisconsin State Investment Board Professor Purchases $160 Million Bitcoin ETF,"According to Odaily, a professor from the State of Wisconsin Investment Board has made a significant purchase of a ETF, amounting to $160 million. This comes after the Investment Board's previous holdings of $64 million in Grayscale GBTC and $99 million in Blackrock IBIT. The State of Wisconsin Investment Board's move into Bitcoin ETFs is a significant development, indicating a growing interest in cryptocurrency investments among institutional investors. The professor's substantial purchase further underscores this trend. It's worth noting that the Investment Board's previous investments in Grayscale GBTC and Blackrock IBIT, two well-known cryptocurrency investment vehicles, have set a precedent for this recent ETF acquisition. The Board's continued investment in the cryptocurrency market demonstrates a strategic approach to diversifying their portfolio and a strong belief in the potential of digital assets."

6/3/2024,"Bitcoin's Current Price Action Mirrors Its 2017 Performance, Suggests Trader","According to U.Today, trader Jake Wujastyk has drawn parallels between 's current price action and its performance in February 2017. Wujastyk compared two Bitcoin breakouts, one from February 2017 and the other from October 2020. In both instances, the major cryptocurrency experienced significant rallies after consolidating below corresponding resistance levels. A similar pattern appears to be unfolding currently, with Bitcoin seemingly preparing for another rally under the $68,000 level. In 2020, Bitcoin reached a new record high just months after the breakout, tripling its price in a span of two months. At present, Bitcoin is trading at $67,723, as per data from cryptocurrency tracking site CoinGecko, with a market valuation of $1.3 trillion. In late March, Bitcoin attempted to surpass the $70,000 level, but the attempt was unsuccessful. The largest cryptocurrency is still down more than 8% from its current all-time high of $73,737, which was achieved in mid-March. U.Today has previously reported that the price could potentially exceed the $150,000 level in 2024 due to declining inflation. However, it's important to note that cryptocurrency prices are highly volatile and can change rapidly."
6/3/2024,"Bitcoin ETFs Gain Prominence in TV Discussions, Says Analyst Eric Balchunas","According to Odaily, Eric Balchunas, an ETF analyst, has noted a significant increase in the visibility and accessibility of ETFs. His observations were shared on platform X, where he highlighted that Bitcoin ETFs have become a topic of discussion on television programs. This development, he pointed out, has occurred in less than six months, indicating the rapid growth and acceptance of Bitcoin ETFs as an asset class. Balchunas's comments underscore the growing mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin ETFs. The fact that these financial products are now being discussed on television programs suggests that they have moved beyond niche financial circles and are now part of broader public discourse. This increased visibility and accessibility are likely to further fuel the growth and adoption of Bitcoin ETFs. However, it's important to note that while the visibility of ETFs has increased, this does not necessarily translate into increased investment or adoption. Investors and potential investors should conduct thorough research and consider their risk tolerance before investing in Bitcoin ETFs or any other type of cryptocurrency-related financial product."
6/3/2024,New Texas University Incorporates Bitcoin Into Its Endowment,"According to Bloomberg, the University of Austin in Texas is incorporating into its endowment. The newly established university, which is welcoming its inaugural class of students this fall, has collaborated with a cryptocurrency platform. 'Bitcoin offers a unique opportunity to further UATX's dedication to nurturing future generations of leaders and innovators,' stated Thomas Hogan, an incoming associate professor at the university.

The cryptocurrency, which has seen a rise of over 60% this year, was trading around $69,400 at midday in New York."
6/3/2024,"Bitcoin's Bull Run Could Reach $150K by 2025, Predicts Crypto Trader Peter Brandt","According to CryptoPotato, renowned crypto trader Peter Brandt has predicted that 's current bull run could peak between $130,000 and $150,000 by late August to early September 2025. This projection is based on historical patterns following Bitcoin's previous halving events, which occur approximately every four years and cut mining rewards by half. Brandt believes these events have significantly shaped Bitcoin's bull market cycles. In his report, Brandt detailed how previous halving dates have represented almost perfect symmetry within past bull market cycles. He noted that the number of weeks from the start of each bull market cycle, typically marked by a significant low following a decline of over 75%, to the halving dates is almost equal to the number of weeks from the halving dates to the following bull market highs. Analyzing past patterns, Brandt pointed to the last Bitcoin bull market, which started about 16 months before the halving on May 11, 2020, and concluded roughly 18 months later. This pattern aligns with previous cycles following the July 9, 2016, and November 28, 2012 halvings. Brandt's analysis suggests that the current bull market began on December 17, 2022, with trading around $16,800. Since then, Bitcoin has surged over 300%, reaching an all-time high of $73,800 on March 14. However, Brandt also warned of a 25% probability that Bitcoin has already reached its bull market peak, given that each cycle's are reducing when compared to the previous one. He also cautioned that if Bitcoin fails to surpass its previous high and drops below $55,000, it could signify an 'exponential decay' in its market value. Brandt stressed the importance for traders to watch for signs of exponential decay carefully."
6/3/2024,U.S. Senator Ted Cruz Joins Bitcoin Mining Community,"According to CryptoPotato, U.S. Senator Ted Cruz, a known advocate for cryptocurrency, has recently purchased three application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) miners. This move marks the initiation of his mining operations in Iraan, Texas. Cruz has been vocal about his support for pro-crypto legislation and his recent purchase further solidifies his position in the crypto community. In his announcement, Cruz expressed his pride in joining the ranks of Texas Bitcoin miners. His move was applauded by Marathon Digital CEO Fred Thiel, who welcomed Cruz to the Bitcoin mining community and acknowledged his contribution to enhancing network security. Texas has become a hub for Bitcoin mining due to its business-friendly laws and affordable energy resources, including wind, , and natural gas. This environment has led to an increase in Bitcoin mining in smaller towns like Iraan, resulting in job creation, increased energy infrastructure investments, and additional tax revenue. A financial disclosure revealed that Cruz purchased worth between $15,000 and $50,000 on January 25, when the price was around $37,000. With Bitcoin currently trading at $69,000, his investment has seen significant growth, assuming he hasn’t sold his holdings. Cruz is not alone in his crypto endeavors. Several senators have disclosed their crypto holdings, reflecting growing political support. Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis and Pennsylvania Senator Pat Toomey are among those who have invested in Bitcoin. In 2021, Cruz opposed a crypto tax proposal in the Senate’s infrastructure bill, which aimed to raise about $28 billion in new tax revenue over a decade. He also introduced a resolution for merchants and vendors on Capitol Hill to accept cryptocurrency payments. Cruz has consistently voiced his opposition to the Federal Reserve’s development of a central bank digital currency (CBDC), citing concerns about privacy, government overreach, and financial surveillance. In related news, Oklahoma lawmakers passed House Bill 1600 on May 30, offering tax credits to digital asset mining operations. Pending the governor’s signature, the bill aims to exempt commercial mining machinery, including servers, computers, and transformers, from taxes. The Oklahoma Association emphasized the bill’s significance, stating it would make state power prices highly competitive for miners and attract investments to revitalize rural areas. The bill is expected to optimize Oklahoma’s electricity grid and reduce power costs for residents."

This significant accumulation of BTC suggests a strong holding sentiment among these addresses, despite the fluctuating market conditions. The data indicates a substantial level of confidence in the cryptocurrency's value, as these addresses continue to hold onto their BTC even as the price hovers between $66,900 and $68,900.

6/4/2024,Bitcoin Active Addresses Experience Significant Fluctuations,"According to Odaily, data from Glassnode reveals that 's active addresses have recently seen substantial fluctuations. Following the halving in April 2024, the number of active addresses significantly decreased due to soaring transaction fees and network congestion. This increase in fees is partly due to the emergence of new protocols like Runes, which have impacted Bitcoin's utility in daily transactions, leading to a noticeable decline in network activity. Historically, active addresses have been a reliable indicator of market phases. For instance, data from 2022 showed that active addresses were stagnant, consistent with the typical bear market pattern observed in past cycles. Bitcoin's market strength is cyclical, usually experiencing a period of reduced activity, followed by a resurgence as market conditions improve. However, it's worth noting that despite the current number of active addresses dropping to a low not seen since 2019, has returned to near its historical high point."

This prediction comes in light of a more positive political environment in the US towards cryptocurrencies. Novogratz made these comments during a recent interview on Bloomberg Television. In the past few weeks, the sentiment towards cryptocurrencies has become more positive, according to Novogratz. This shift in sentiment is evident in the actions of the US Securities and Exchange Commission, which has taken steps towards approving exchange-traded funds that invest directly in Ether. Additionally, political donations supporting pro-crypto candidates have increased, and even presidential candidates have been competing on their stance on cryptocurrencies. Novogratz stated, 'I think we are getting skewed to the upside. We kind of got to the finish line. DC has finally agreed in principle that crypto legislation has to happen, that should be bipartisan.' However, not all recent developments have been positive. President Joe Biden vetoed a guidance known as staff accounting bulletin No. 121, which has drawn criticism from banks since its publication in 2022. Banks argue that it effectively restricts them from scaling up services to hold digital assets on behalf of customers by making it too costly."
6/4/2024,Bitcoin ETFs Contribute Significantly to BlackRock and Fidelity's Inflows,"According to CryptoPotato, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) from BlackRock and Fidelity have played a significant role in the companies' overall ETF inflows this year. Data from Bloomberg Intelligence reveals that these Bitcoin ETFs have accounted for 26% and 56% of BlackRock and Fidelity's year-to-date inflows, respectively. BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and Fidelity's Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) have collectively attracted substantial investments since their launch nearly five months ago. Farside Investor data shows that IBIT has seen $16.6 billion in inflows, while FBTC has received $8.9 billion. Despite these figures, Vanguard, which does not offer any spot Bitcoin ETFs, remains the leader in total ETF inflows for 2024, amassing $102.8 billion, surpassing BlackRock's $65.1 billion. BlackRock continues to be the largest ETF provider in the U.S. stock market, with 433 ETFs listed and $2.8 trillion in assets under management. Fidelity holds the 11th position with 70 ETFs and $74.04 billion in assets. However, the of investments into these products has plateaued in recent weeks, with many issuers experiencing days of zero inflows and outflows. The overall market for spot ETFs hit a milestone on May 24, with all ETFs collectively holding over one million BTC, most of which is allocated to U.S. products among the 32 available ETFs. BlackRock's IBIT recently surpassed the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) as the world's largest spot Bitcoin ETF on May 28. According to the Apollo Bitcoin TRACKER, IBIT now holds 291,567 BTC, valued at over $20 billion at current prices. Grayscale, which initially led the market with 620,000 BTC, has seen substantial outflows and currently holds 285,139 BTC, worth approximately $19.6 billion. BlackRock's increasing dominance in the spot Bitcoin ETF market indicates that being a first mover doesn't guarantee long-term success. Early players like Grayscale faced challenges such as selling pressure and high fees of 1.5%, compared to about 0.25% charged by newer competitors like Fidelity and Investments. BlackRock's success is partly due to its strong distribution network among financial advisors and wealth managers."

The BoC is the first among the G-7 central banks to initiate what is expected to be a cycle of easier monetary policy, following years of efforts to curb inflation. It is anticipated that the European Central Bank will be the next major central bank to ease its policy in its upcoming meeting. Despite suggestions from some members of the U.S. Federal Reserve that the bank might refrain from any rate cuts throughout 2024, recent economic data has shown a slowdown in both economic growth and inflation. As per CME FedWatch, traders have currently priced in a nearly 60% chance of a rate cut either before or at the Fed's September meeting.

6/6/2024,QCP Capital: Upcoming US Unemployment and CPI Data Could Propel Bitcoin to New Highs,"According to a report by BlockBeats, analysts at the crypto asset trading firm QCP Capital have indicated that upcoming economic data releases in the U.S. could serve as catalysts for Bitcoin to reach new all-time highs. Specifically, they point to the U.S. unemployment claims report released today, along with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) data set to be released next week, as key factors that could significantly impact Bitcoin's price. QCP Capital analysts suggest that a combination of favourable unemployment and CPI data could drive positive market sentiment towards Bitcoin. Additionally, growing market expectations for potential interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve could also contribute to a bullish trend for the leading cryptocurrency. The relationship between economic indicators and Bitcoin's price trend is driven by several factors: 1 . Unemployment Data : Lower-than-expected unemployment claims may signal economic stability, potentially boosting investor confidence in riskier assets like Bitcoin. Conversely, higher unemployment could lead to expectations of monetary easing to support the economy, which historically benefits asset prices including cryptocurrencies. 2 . CPI Data : The CPI report will provide insights into inflation trends. Should the CPI indicate that inflation is cooling, it may reinforce expectations that the Fed could pivot towards lower interest rates. Lower interest rates tend to decrease the attractiveness of fiat currencies, thereby making alternative assets like Bitcoin more appealing. 3 . Interest Rate Expectations : Market sentiment that leans towards the likelihood of interest rate cuts often drives investors to seek higher returns in alternative investments, including cryptocurrencies."

The head and shoulders pattern in Bitcoin's price chart suggests an imminent rally to $83,000, with the resistance line likely to be breached in the coming days. The ideal time for this breakthrough is expected to be today (Friday, June 7) or next week (Wednesday, June 12). The bullish sentiment is further supported by the anticipated global central bank easing cycle, as evidenced by recent interest rate cuts in Canada, Denmark, and Europe. With weaker growth, employment, and consumer spending in the United States, it is expected that inflation will slow down, creating a favorable environment for risk assets like Bitcoin.

6/7/2024,Strong U.S. Job Growth Impacts Bitcoin and Stock Markets,"According to CoinDesk, the U.S. job market showed unexpected strength in May, with the government reporting an addition of 272,000 jobs. This figure significantly surpassed the estimated 185,000 and April's revised figure of 165,000. The unemployment rate for May was 4.0%, slightly higher than the estimated and April's rate of 3.9%. The robust job data led to a decline in , stock, and markets. Bitcoin's price fell sharply from a near two-month high of $72,000 following the release of the job data. At the time of reporting, Bitcoin was trading at $70,900, marking a 0.5% decrease over the past 24 hours. The report also showed that average hourly earnings rose by 0.4% in May, surpassing forecasts of 0.3% and April's 0.2%. On a year-over-year basis, average hourly earnings were higher by 4.1%, compared to estimates of 3.9% and April's 4.0%. Interest rates, which had been rising through the first part of 2024, have been on a downtrend for about the last five weeks. This is due to recent U.S. economic data indicating a slowdown in both economic growth and inflation. The 10-year Treasury yield was at 4.30% ahead of the job data, compared to a 2024 high of 4.71% in late April. The decline in rates has been beneficial for risk assets, with major U.S. stock market averages and prices surging. The belief that major Western economies are about to enter a monetary easing cycle gained further credibility this week when both the Bank of Canada and the European Central Bank cut their respective benchmark interest rates for the first time in several years. The odds of a Fed rate cut have also increased recently, with investors pricing in about a 55% chance of a move on or before the bank's September policy meeting. However, the strong job data may reverse this thinking, at least in the short term. Besides Bitcoin's swift pullback, the 10-year Treasury yield has risen by 12 basis points to 4.42%, and U.S. stock index futures are indicating a lower open. Other indicators show the U.S. dollar surging 0.5% and gold tumbling more than 2%."
6/7/2024,"Key Factors That Could Propel Bitcoin To $100,000, According To Analyst","According to U.Today, Charles Edwards, the founder of Capriole Investments, has shared his insights on why , the world's leading cryptocurrency, has not yet reached the $100,000 mark. He also outlined the key factors that could potentially drive the price of Bitcoin upwards in the coming months. Edwards initiated a discussion on a social media platform, questioning why Bitcoin hasn't hit the $100,000 price point despite the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs. He noted that Bitcoin has only increased by 50% since January when the SEC approved the ETFs, leaving many to wonder why the cryptocurrency hasn't surged higher. At the time of his discussion, Bitcoin was trading slightly above $71,000. Edwards identified several key factors that could potentially drive a strong rise in 's value in the future. Firstly, he pointed out that the market is currently battling against long-term holder selling. He noted that the number of long-term Bitcoin-holding wallets, those that have held the cryptocurrency for more than two years, has dropped from an all-time high of 57% in December 2023 to 54% today. This 3% drop represents 630,000 BTC, which is 300% of the total BTC supply that Bitcoin ETFs have purchased in the U.S. since January. The second factor, according to Edwards, is that the market has not yet fully felt the impact of the halving event that took place in April, which saw Bitcoin's daily issuance drop by 50%. He believes that over the next year, the gap between the ETFs purchasing Bitcoin and the BTC being mined will widen significantly. He also suggested that financial institutions need time to assess the situation and allocate funds for Bitcoin purchases, which is why spot ETFs are likely to remain the leading purchasers of BTC for at least this year. In conclusion, Edwards identified three key drivers necessary for to start rising sharply: higher average daily ETF buying, lower long-term holder selling, and growth in U.S. liquidity."

6/8/2024,Bitcoin's 'HODL' Culture May Fade With Growing ETF Adoption,"According to CNBC, the long-standing practice of 'HODLing' or holding on to bitcoin despite its extreme price fluctuations, may decrease as the adoption of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) increases. This change is expected to occur particularly among traditional investors who are used to regularly rebalancing their portfolios and are now adding exposure. The cryptocurrency has become more institutionalized in recent years, and this trend is expected to grow with the launch of ETFs that track bitcoin's price. Donald Marron, director of economic policy initiatives at Urban Institute, stated at the 2024 Vision conference in Austin, Texas, that many people in the community are 'diamond-handed holders'. He suggested that if these individuals allocated 1% to bitcoin and never touched it, they could see significant wealth if bitcoin prices continue to rise. However, Marron also noted that traditional asset allocation could lead to questions about rebalancing portfolios, which could mean selling off some bitcoin. Julio Moreno, head of research at CryptoQuant, pointed out that every HODLer eventually becomes a seller. Currently, long-term holders are selling, which is typical during bull markets, after accumulating during the bear market. Matt Hougan, chief investment officer at Bitwise Asset Management, suggested treating bitcoin like any other asset and including it in the rebalancing process. He noted that adding rebalancing to a portfolio can dramatically increase 'sharpes' and other measures. Sharpe ratios help investors assess the return they get from an investment relative to the amount of risk they take. Michael Allegue, an investment officer at MassMutual, suggested that rebalancing could help reduce bitcoin's notorious volatility, which often deters many investors. As more institutional capital enters the market, there's potential for volatility dampening as many firms, including MassMutual, will likely be rebalancing accounts rather than purely buying and holding."
6/8/2024,Bitcoin Bears May Face Risk As Spot Buying Volume Increases,"According to U.Today, bears could be at risk as the open interest on the shorts' side is gradually increasing, in line with the spot buying volume. This divergence often results in short squeezes which, for Bitcoin, could likely result in a breakthrough and a move toward $100,000. The Spot Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD), which shows the total net buying or selling on the spot market, is the first metric to note. In this case, there is a growing spot buy delta, and the Spot CVD is leading with the price. This suggests that the recent rise in Bitcoin prices is driven by the spot market. In simpler terms, as more people buy Bitcoin on the spot market, the price increases. However, perpetual contracts tell a slightly different story. Futures traders may be feeling bearish as the Perp CVD is falling more than the price. Additionally, there is an increase in selling. This indicates that while there is buying pressure on the spot market, the futures market is more likely to be selling. The primary driver of the recent price surge on appears to be buying on the spot market. A rising Spot CVD in conjunction with the price indicates a high level of buying interest. Despite this, the futures market (perps) is showing bearish sentiment, with a falling Perp CVD and increasing selling pressure. The growing spot buy delta suggests that there may be buying momentum. This could be encouraging for spot traders looking to buy or hold Bitcoin. On the other hand, the declining Perp CVD suggests bearish sentiment, which could signal caution for those who trade futures. Selling is the prevailing trend on the futures market, which could lead to price adjustments or increased volatility."
6/8/2024,Bitcoin Investor Lark Davies Predicts Imminent Bullish Run Amid Crypto Market Rally,"According to U.Today, Lark Davies, a well-known entrepreneur and investor, has predicted a forthcoming bullish run for the leading cryptocurrency. This prediction comes in the midst of a wider crypto market rally, which has seen Bitcoin (BTC) rise to over $71,000. Davies pointed out several factors that could drive the crypto market towards a bull run in the near future. The primary factor is the increased inflows gathered from the adoption of Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in the U.S. In the past 18 days, Davies revealed that these ETFs have bought 56,150 BTC, equivalent to over a four-month supply of BTC. Furthermore, Davies believes that the potential launch of ’s spot ETF will significantly impact the market. He stated that Ethereum ETFs are set to start trading soon. Davies also noted that the ongoing accumulation of Bitcoin by institutions such as MicroStrategy, Block, and Semler Scientific could also affect Bitcoin's future trajectory. Davies stated, 'Institutions, wealth managers, and pension funds worldwide are lining up to own a piece of the pie. This bull run is going to be way crazier than you think.' At the time of reporting, BTC is trading at $71,456, marking an increase of 0.27% in the last 24 hours. The trading volume has risen by 14.5% to over $30 billion. There seems to be a mixed sentiment regarding the approval of spot ETFs. Jan van Eck, CEO of VanEck, believes the approval of spot Ethereum ETF has signaled a historic shift. VanEck is among other applicants that have received approvals from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). On the other hand, banking giant JPMorgan suggests that the Ethereum ETFs could attract a much lower share of inflows than anticipated when it finally starts trading. The bank predicts inflows of $3 billion for the ETH products this year, but this amount could double if staking is allowed."

6/8/2024,Bitcoin Advocate Samson Mow Proposes GameStop to Add Bitcoin to Its Treasury,"According to U.Today, maximalist Samson Mow has proposed a new bullish scenario for Bitcoin on a social media platform. Mow, who is the CEO of Bitcoin adoption-focused company Jan3, suggested that GameStop, the video game retail sales company known for its 2021 short squeeze, should incorporate the leading cryptocurrency into its corporate treasury. Mow believes that this move would create a 'double bullish thesis', leading to a significant increase in both Bitcoin and GameStop's value. Mow's suggestion echoes a recent statement by prominent U.S. financier Anthony Scaramucci, who also expressed his belief that GameStop should invest in Bitcoin. This comes after GameStop's shares fell by nearly 40% following the company's disclosure of its recent financial results and plans to issue more shares. In addition to this, financial analyst and investor Keith Gill, also known as 'Roaring Kitty' on social media platforms, planned to announce his billionaire status due to his substantial investment in GameStop during a live stream on YouTube. However, this announcement was not made due to a sharp drop in GameStop's stock price, which followed a recent 50% surge. Mow's proposal for GameStop to add to its treasury is seen as a potential strategy to boost the company's financial standing and market value."

Before the price drop on June 7, volatility was within the bottom 6% of all 15-day periods, according to Swan Bitcoin's Chief Investment Officer, Rapha Zagury. Source: Rapha Zagury Bitcoin Low Volatility Period: - Historic Low Volatility : Bitcoin's price movement over the 15 days up to June 7 was so minimal that it approached historic lows. This period of low volatility was within the bottom 6% of occurrences in Bitcoin's history. - Range-Bound Trading: During this time, Bitcoin traded within a narrow 7% range between $66,936 and $71,656. Bitcoin Volatility Data: - 15-Day Rolling Volatility : Zagury noted that the 15-day rolling volatility was at 23%, which is close to the lower level historically observed. - Extended Stability : This period highlighted an extended duration of stability where Bitcoin's price was ""stuck in a range."" Market Response Bitcoin Price Decline on June 7: - Sharp Decline : On June 7, Bitcoin's price dropped by 3.33% to $69,264, according to CoinMarketCap data. - Trigger Event: The price decline coincided with the release of the U.S. Employment Situation Summary Report, which indicated stronger-than-expected job growth, signalling that the Federal Reserve may not cut inflation rates on June 11. Previous Low Volatility Periods: - Short-Term Returns : Zagury highlighted that following previous periods of similarly low volatility, Bitcoin's average return over the next 30 days stood at 20.95%. However, returns varied widely, with a minimum return decline of 32.06% and a maximum return of 218.40%. - Long-Term Insights : Over a 365-day period following similar low volatility, the minimum return was 55.59%, while the average return was an impressive 820.82%. Although these historical trends offer valuable insights, Zagury emphasized that they should not be seen as direct predictions for future performance but rather as a means to understand market dynamics. Given the recent low volatility, market participants may expect significant price movements as volatility begins to normalize. Upcoming economic indicators, such as inflation rates and Federal Reserve decisions, will likely play a crucial role in shaping Bitcoin's price trajectory."

6/9/2024,Bitcoin ETFs Witness Significant Inflow Surge Amid Market Speculations,"According to U.Today, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have seen a significant surge in inflows, indicating strong investor confidence. On June 7, ETFs reportedly added a net inflow of 1,901 Bitcoin, valued at $132 million, within a 24-hour period. This marks the 19th consecutive day of such movements, as noted by Julian Fahrer. In terms of inflow distribution, BlackRock recorded the highest with an impressive 2,450 BTC, worth $169.2 million. Conversely, Grayscale experienced an outflow of 524 BTC, valued at $36.3 million, while secured a double-digit inflow of 99 BTC, amounting to $6.9 million. Despite these substantial inflows indicating a significant increase in investor interest, the price of fell below the $70,000 mark to $69,428.07, a 2.56% drop. This lack of price reaction has led to speculation within the wider cryptocurrency community. There is a general sense of uncertainty surrounding Bitcoin's performance, particularly given its slow rise post-halving. Some fear a bearish session may be imminent. However, the volume of inflows suggests the opposite. Historically, the absence of price movement despite massive inflows has signaled an upcoming bullish run. As such, prices may reach new highs, as predicted by industry leaders like Mike Novogratz, Robert Kiyosaki, and Tom Lee. Novogratz is confident that could reach a six-digit figure before the end of the year, while Kiyosaki predicts a striking BTC price of $350,000 by August. Analysts suggest that Bitcoin’s price tends to follow similar patterns after halving events, with past cycles showing significant price peaks. If these predictions prove accurate, the substantial inflows and accumulations by BlackRock, Grayscale, and other investors could position them for significant profit-taking when the value of the largest cryptocurrency asset soars."
6/10/2024,Bitcoin Core Urges Users To Upgrade To Latest Version,"According to Odaily, Core's Optech Newsletter #306 has recommended users to upgrade to Bitcoin Core 25.0 or a higher version within the next two weeks, with the latest version being 27.0. This advice comes as part of a discussion among several Bitcoin Core project members regarding a new policy on vulnerability disclosure. Under this new policy, low severity vulnerabilities will be disclosed approximately two weeks after the release of a new version. Most other vulnerabilities, on the other hand, will be disclosed after the affected versions have expired. This move is seen as a proactive measure to ensure the security and integrity of the Bitcoin Core system. Users are therefore urged to upgrade to the latest version of Core to benefit from the latest security updates and to protect their digital assets from potential vulnerabilities. The Bitcoin Core team is committed to maintaining the highest level of security for its users and this new policy is a testament to that commitment."
6/10/2024,Major Bitcoin Mining Companies Reveal Production Data for May 2024,"According to Odaily, data from Farside Investors indicates that major mining companies have released their production data for May 2024. May marks the first full month since the halving event, and the production has reportedly decreased by approximately 40% compared to the previous month. The halving event, a significant occurrence in the Bitcoin mining industry, effectively reduces the reward for mining new blocks by 50%. This event, which takes place approximately every four years, has a substantial impact on the production rates of Bitcoin mining companies. The reported 40% decrease in production aligns with the expected outcomes of the halving event. However, it is important to note that these figures are preliminary and may be subject to change as more data becomes available. The impact of the halving event on the overall market remains to be seen, as it depends on a variety of factors including market demand, mining technology advancements, and regulatory developments."
6/10/2024,"Bitcoin Could Reach $10 Million, Predicts Crypto Entrepreneur Samson Mow","According to U.Today, Samson Mow, a well-known figure in the cryptocurrency industry, has predicted a potential surge in 's value to $10 million. This prediction comes at a time when Bitcoin's price has been relatively stable, hovering around $70,000 since mid-May. The lack of significant price movement has led to speculation about possible market manipulation and has left traders and investors feeling frustrated. Adam Back, a prominent figure in the cryptocurrency world with connections to Bitcoin's elusive creator Satoshi Nakamoto, suggested that the current price stagnation could be due to certain sellers urgently needing cash. These sellers are reportedly offloading their holdings, and once their limited supply is depleted, the market could begin to rise again. Back pointed to data supporting the existence of basis trading, where collateral is Bitcoin rather than Bitcoin ETFs. He also noted that buying activity is still happening through CME futures, indicating latent demand. Mow agreed with Back's analysis, highlighting the increase in short interest from newer, less experienced traders who misunderstand the cash and carry trade. He suggested that the significant shorting activity on futures is likely unsustainable and could lead to substantial liquidations soon, which would drive 's price up. Mow compared the current suppressed price to a compressed coil ready to spring, indicating that it is set for a significant increase. Mow also stressed that Bitcoin trading below $70,000 is an anomaly given its trajectory. He expressed confidence that not only would $1 million per Bitcoin eventually seem like a bargain, but the price would ultimately surge to $10 million, making it a crucial investment for the future."

This phenomenal growth rate dwarfs the returns of Warren Buffett's renowned portfolio and even the broader U.S. stock markets.

Market Perception and Adoption Gold vs. Bitcoin: - Gold: Has provided a modest average annual return of 6% over the past decade. It offers stability and acts as a hedge against economic downturns. - Bitcoin : Often referred to as ""digital gold,"" it has gained favour as a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation. This perception has driven its appeal as a valuable asset. Spot U.S. Bitcoin ETFs cumulative inflows. Source: Farside Investors Institutional Adoption - MicroStrategy and Tesla : These companies have added Bitcoin to their reserves, validating its role as a strategic asset. - Spot Bitcoin ETFs : The launch of these funds has further entrenched Bitcoin's status among institutional investors. Volatility Comparison Despite its reputation for volatility, Bitcoin has recently shown lower price fluctuations compared to several S&P 500 stocks, including Tesla, Meta, and Nvidia. This trend suggests a maturing market with potentially stable long-term returns. While Warren Buffett's portfolio represents a conservative, long-term investment strategy with consistent returns and manageable risk, Bitcoin offers staggering potential returns paired with significant volatility. The decision between these two investment strategies ultimately hinges on the investor's risk tolerance and financial goals. BTC holders have enjoyed exceptional gains—yet those gains come with the caveat of higher risk and potential downturns. Conversely, Warren Buffett's risk-averse strategy has proven its merit over decades, appealing to those who prioritize steady growth and stability. As Bitcoin continues to evolve and gain acceptance as a major asset class, its relationship with traditional portfolios and mainstream financial instruments will likely continue to develop. Whether chosen for its potential for high returns or its emerging stability, Bitcoin remains a compelling option in the modern investment landscape."

6/10/2024,10x Research: Stablecoins Slowdown Preventing Bitcoin from Reaching New All-Time Highs,"According to Golden Finance: Bitcoin is facing a significant hurdle in breaking its all-time high, which 10x Research attributes to a notable slowdown in stablecoin minting following the Bitcoin halving event. Bitcoin Market Dynamics: - Current Range: Bitcoin is currently near the top of its trading range and is struggling to break through its previous all-time high. - Bitcoin Halving Impact : The halving event on April 20 has led to a significant slowdown in the minting of stablecoins, impeding Bitcoin's upward momentum. Stablecoin Trends: - Stablecoin Minting Decline : There has been a marked decrease in the issuance of new stablecoins post-halving. - Large Wallet Holding Decline : The number of wallets containing more than $10 million in stablecoins has also declined, indicating reduced liquidity inflows into the Bitcoin market. Exchange Withdrawals: - Significant Withdrawals : Over the past month, approximately $6.75 billion worth of Bitcoin (about 97,000 BTC, nearing 100,000 BTC) was withdrawn from exchanges. - Affected Exchanges : Major withdrawals were observed from U.S.-focused exchanges, including Kraken (down 55,000 BTC or $3.8 billion) and Coinbase (down 24,000 BTC or $1.7 billion). The reduced minting of stablecoins and the decline in large stablecoin wallet holdings suggest that the liquidity available for purchasing Bitcoin has decreased, constraining demand and price growth. The significant withdrawal of Bitcoin from exchanges further indicates that investors may be moving their assets to cold storage, possibly reflecting a cautious or long-term holding strategy rather than immediate trading. Bitcoin's struggle to break through its all-time high can be attributed to several factors, including the post-halving slowdown in stablecoin minting and substantial withdrawals from major exchanges. As these factors contribute to reduced liquidity and trading volume, Bitcoin's path to reaching new price levels faces substantial challenges. Market participants will need to closely monitor stablecoin trends and exchange flows to gauge future price movements."
6/10/2024,"Cardano (ADA) Price Touches Key Weekly Support Level, Potential Bullish Trend Ahead","According to U.Today, the price of (ADA) has reached a crucial weekly support level, a point where buyers may intervene to prevent further drops. After weeks of consistent declines, ADA hit the weekly SMA 50 at $0.433, a level that has successfully supported the ADA price since late October 2023. The significance of ADA reaching this point cannot be overstated. The cryptocurrency market, led by , ended the previous week in negative territory as the government's employment data for May showed a higher than expected increase, with 272,000 jobs added. At the time of reporting, ADA had risen by 0.54% in the last 24 hours to $0.439, a slight increase from the previous day's low of $0.432. The current price movement suggests that ADA is at a major support level, where a significant amount of ADA, nearly 3.47 billion coins, is held by a large number of addresses. Data from IntoTheBlock shows that 3.47 billion ADA were purchased by 350,940 addresses in the range of $0.371 and $0.431 at an average price of $0.3944. If can maintain above this support level, including its weekly SMA 50 support, and gain upward momentum, it could signal the beginning of a new bullish trend. Traders and analysts will be closely monitoring Cardano's price movement in the coming days to determine its next steps. Cardano is currently trading in a symmetrical triangle pattern, indicating a tug of war between bulls and bears. Traders were able to push the ADA price over the daily SMA 50, which was $0.461, on June 7. ADA briefly reached highs of $0.49 before meeting resistance and the price began to fall. ADA is now trying to recover from a four-day losing streak. It remains to be seen how far bulls will take the recent price rebound. If buyers can break through the $0.49 barrier, ADA might rally to $0.62. There is a slight resistance at $0.57, but it is expected to be overcome. However, if Cardano falls below the daily SMA 50 at $0.461, it could mean that bulls are taking profits, keeping the ADA price trapped inside the triangle for some time."
6/10/2024,"Long-Term Bitcoin Holders' Distribution to ETFs Hinders $70,000 Breakthrough","According to U.Today, trader Gert van Lagen has suggested that the distribution of from long-term holders to new ETF holders is a significant factor preventing the cryptocurrency from breaking the $70,000 mark. In May, van Lagen observed that this distribution process was already well underway, a conclusion drawn from on-chain data showing a turnover in coins held for over a year. Van Lagen has previously noted that such distributions often lead to 'parabolic' price discoveries, followed by extended bear markets. Despite Bitcoin's struggle to surpass the crucial $70,000 level, many believe the current bull run is far from over. Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz, for instance, has predicted that Bitcoin could reach $100,000 by year's end if it can overcome the major resistance area around $73,000 soon. Similarly, Fundstrat co-founder Tom Lee and renowned commodity trader Peter Brandt have suggested a potential peak of $150,000 for Bitcoin during this cycle. In other news, U.S.-based spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have seen 19 consecutive days of inflows, with the second-largest ever inflows ($880 million) recorded on a recent Tuesday. Leading analyst Eric Balchunas has commented on the impressive resilience of ETFs, despite their volatile performance. However, the Bitcoin price took a hit following the release of U.S. jobs data, which showed a higher than expected increase in jobs added in May. The robust labor market could deter the U.S. Federal Reserve from implementing rate cuts, a situation that could negatively impact risk assets like Bitcoin."

6/10/2024,MicroStrategy's Chairman Michael Saylor Hails Bitcoin's Creator Satoshi Nakamoto,"According to U.Today, Michael Saylor, the chairman of MicroStrategy and a well-known advocate, recently praised Satoshi Nakamoto, the anonymous creator of Bitcoin. Saylor metaphorically described Satoshi's creation of Bitcoin as starting a 'fire in cyberspace,' emphasizing the transformative impact of this digital asset on the world. Satoshi Nakamoto, whose real identity is still unknown, published the Bitcoin whitepaper in 2008 and mined the first block of the Bitcoin blockchain in 2009. His vision was to establish a decentralized, peer-to-peer electronic cash system that operates independently of central authorities. This vision has since grown into a global phenomenon, with Bitcoin leading the cryptocurrency revolution. The 'fire' Saylor refers to could symbolize the spark of innovation that has sparked a worldwide shift towards decentralized finance. Satoshi's creation of Bitcoin has unquestionably ignited a transformative force in the digital world, reshaping our understanding of money, value, and decentralization. Bitcoin's price has risen in the past week to within 2.5% of the all-time high of $73,798 set in mid-March, driven by increasing demand for exchange-traded funds (ETFs). At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $69,711, up nearly 161% annually. The boom this year accelerated after the Securities and Exchange Commission permitted ETFs that invest directly in Bitcoin in January. In May, the regulator moved towards authorizing comparable spot ETFs. As considers its next price move, crypto analyst Ali noted that it is anchored in a strong support zone between $69,380 and $67,350. This is where 1.97 million addresses acquired 964,000 BTC, and maintaining this level might be crucial for BTC to maintain its upward momentum. In a bullish tone, Ali reported that approximately 22,647 BTC, worth over $1.57 billion, were recently withdrawn from crypto exchanges."

6/11/2024,US Spot Bitcoin ETFs Show Strong Start in June,"According to CryptoPotato, US spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), including GBTC, have shown a strong start in June despite indications of diminishing excitement. In the first week of June alone, these ETFs collectively bought 25,729 BTC. This figure is almost equivalent to the total amount of bitcoins purchased in May. Since their inception in mid-January, these spot Bitcoin ETFs have attracted nearly $15.7 billion in net inflows from investors.

The data reveals that these 11 ETFs collectively manage over $61 billion in total assets under management (AUM), with BlackRock and Fidelity leading in the US. The US-based spot ETFs had a remarkable streak of 19 consecutive days with only inflows. However, this record ended exactly a month after it began. Data from Farside shows that the ETFs had $64.9 million withdrawn on June 10. As expected, the biggest loser was Grayscale’s GBTC, which saw nearly $40 million taken out.

6/11/2024,"Key Factors Behind Bitcoin's Struggle to Surpass $70,000","According to U.Today, has been unable to maintain a value above $70,000, and several factors may be contributing to this. The recent cluster data of liquidations, ETF inflows, and market trends provide some insights. The liquidation heatmap data reveals significant sell-offs that have contributed to Bitcoin's price decrease. The $72,000, $69,000, and $66,000 levels experienced substantial clusters of liquidations, indicating strong selling pressure. This pressure resulted from the forced closure of leveraged positions, causing the price to drop. This cascading effect from liquidations often leads to a rapid and sharp decline in Bitcoin's price. Another significant factor is the withdrawal from U.S. ETFs that track . After 19 days of inflows, these ETFs experienced a net outflow of $64.93 million on Monday. This trend suggests that investors are shifting from accumulation to profit-taking or risk reduction. Grayscale's GBTC had the highest outflow, totaling $40 million, followed by Invesco Galaxy Digital's BTCO, Valkyrie's Bitcoin ETF, and Fidelity's FBTC. The withdrawal from Bitcoin ETFs indicates a decrease in institutional interest, despite the relatively low volume of outflows. Lastly, the market dynamics show a general decline in enthusiasm. Despite a 19-day streak of net inflows totaling over $4 billion, bringing the total net inflow for spot Bitcoin ETFs since January to $15 billion, the overall trend has turned negative. The only funds to record net inflows of $6 million and $8 million, respectively, were Bitwise's BITB and BlackRock's IBIT. This shift in sentiment is likely due to profit-taking following an extended period of positive inflows, not only among institutional investors."

6/11/2024,Bitcoin Maximalist Predicts Bullish Future Despite Recent Price Drop,"According to U.Today, Samson Mow, CEO of adoption-focused company Jan3, has made a bullish prediction about Bitcoin's future, despite its recent price drop. Mow shared a post on his X platform account that sparked a flurry of responses from the Bitcoin community. In his post, Mow presented a diagram illustrating the proportion of available capital in the market versus Bitcoin, both in terms of circulation and potential mining. The diagram, although lacking specific figures, visually demonstrated that the amount of available Bitcoin is minuscule compared to the capital that could be used to purchase it. Mow's post was a response to the recent drop in Bitcoin's price. He tweeted that while it may be disconcerting to watch the price fall, it's important to remember where it will inevitably end up. Mow is among the Bitcoin maximalists who believe that the cryptocurrency will eventually reach a price of $1 million per coin. Despite the current decline in Bitcoin's price, Mow expressed surprise given the unprecedented level of adoption the cryptocurrency is currently experiencing. In response to Mow's post, several enthusiasts pointed out that the available capital's triangle should be much larger and Bitcoin's much smaller. Mow responded by suggesting a closer look at the larger triangle of capital, which he believes extends beyond the diagram's boundaries. Bitcoin's price has seen a significant drop over the past 24 hours, falling almost 4% from the $70,000 price level it had regained on Monday to $67,453. This follows a similar price drop over the weekend, when Bitcoin fell from above $71,660 to the $69,000 mark."

6/11/2024,Crypto Analyst PlanB Predicts Bitcoin Price for the Next Five Years,"According to U.Today, PlanB, a well-known crypto analyst and the creator of the stock-to- (S2F) model, has shared his predictions for 's (BTC) price for the next five years, from 2024 to 2028. The analyst predicts that Bitcoin will reach $150,000 by the end of 2024, $800,000 by 2025, $400,000 by 2026, $300,000 by 2027, and $400,000 by 2028. These predictions are based on the S2F model, which compares Bitcoin’s trend with previous cycles and aligns with the S2F^3 power law model. PlanB acknowledges that these predictions may seem unrealistic, but he asserts that a price of $800,000 would align with the best fitting, highest R2, historical data model. However, he also points out potential risks that could disrupt this bullish forecast, including hacks, scams, defaults, forks, and regulatory crackdowns. Jeroen Blokland, founder of the Blokland Smart Multi-Asset Fund, noted that a Bitcoin price of $0.8 million would give it a market cap close to that of gold. Whether PlanB’s bullish price prediction for will come true depends on several factors. The sentiment of investors towards the leading digital asset will play a crucial role in determining its future price movement, as price increases often follow positive market sentiment. PlanB has previously stated that he expects Bitcoin to continue to see accumulation from investors in 2024-2025. If this trend continues, his Bitcoin prediction could become a reality. Another key factor that could push Bitcoin's price higher is increased adoption from institutional players through spot Bitcoin ETF products."

Bitcoin Holds Above Key Support Areas - Support Zone : Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView show Bitcoin's price oscillating between $58,000 and $72,000 for over ten weeks after retreating from its all-time highs. - Retesting Resistance as Support : Analyst Rekt Capital noted that the current price range is retesting an area that previously served as stiff resistance. This area, particularly around $66,000, is now acting as support. - Insights from Rekt Capital : ""Bitcoin has successfully retested the black Mid-Range as support (~$66,000) on the recent pullback. Any downside volatility below black is bonus territory."" - Elliot Wave Oscillator : Another analyst, Moustache, identified this level as crucial, referencing the Elliot Wave Oscillator Methodology. Historically, when BTC has retested this line, it has led to significant parabolic uptrends, as seen in 2012, 2017, and 2020. - Historical Patterns: Previous retests of this level have signalled the start of the most euphoric periods in crypto markets, suggesting the potential for upcoming bullish momentum. 2. High Crowd Buying Interest - Increased Buyer Activity : According to market intelligence firm Santiment, Bitcoin's drop below $67,000 on June 13 led to the second-largest spike in crowd-buying interest in the past two months. - Santiment's Insight: ""Interest in Buying Bitcoin surges, while selling interest stays dormant after a dip to $66.6K."" - Retail Investor Confidence : The rise in buying interest suggests that retail investors view the recent price drop as a buying opportunity, indicating confidence in a quick recovery. - Crypto Fear & Greed Index : Data from Alternative.me demonstrates that the Crypto Fear & Greed Index remains in the ""greed"" zone at 74, up from 70 on June 13 and 64 last month. This positive social sentiment signals a bullish outlook among various investor cohorts. 3. Declining Bitcoin Balance on Exchanges - Exchange Balances : Onchain data from CryptoQuant reveal that the BTC balance on exchanges has reached a five-year low of 2.822 million BTC, after a 3.6% drop over the past 30 days. - Self-Custody Signals: A decreasing BTC balance on exchanges generally means that investors are moving their tokens into self-custody wallets, indicating a lack of intention to sell. This is typically a bullish signal, as it suggests that investors are anticipating higher future prices. - Market Implications : Lower balances on exchanges reduce the available supply for potential sell-offs, creating a supply constraint that could drive prices higher if demand increases. The combination of strong technical support heightened buying interest among investors, and declining exchange balances creates a favourable setup for Bitcoin's price recovery. Analysts believe that these factors, coupled with historical patterns of bullish rallies following key support level retests, indicate that Bitcoin is poised for a significant uptrend. This confluence of supportive indicators highlights a promising buy-the-dip opportunity, suggesting that a BTC price recovery is potentially on the horizon."
6/14/2024,3 Reasons Why $65K Marks the Bottom for Bitcoin,"According to Cointelegraph: Bitcoin has demonstrated remarkable resilience amid recent price drops, suggesting that the $65,000 level is solidifying as a key support zone. Despite briefly testing $65,000 on June 14, Bitcoin has not closed below $66,000 since May 17. Several factors underpin this resilience, including Washington's evolving stance on crypto, impending monetary policy shifts, and robust Bitcoin derivatives metrics. Here are three compelling reasons why $65,000 may mark the bottom for Bitcoin: Bitcoin 2-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas.ch 1. Increasingly Positive Regulatory Sentiment in Washington - Congressional Review Act : On May 16, U.S. lawmakers passed a Congressional Review Act to scrutinize a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rule related to the recording of crypto assets on balance sheets. Senator Cynthia Lummis hailed this as the first standalone crypto legislation passed by Congress. - Political Support: Despite President Joe Biden’s veto of the resolution, the vote's initial passage signals growing support and influence of crypto advocates in U.S. politics. Craig Warmke of the Bitcoin Policy Institute noted the ""growing number"" and ""rising influence"" of crypto participants. - Economic Incentives for Banks: The banking sector has economic motives to venture into cryptocurrency custody services. Daniel McCabe, Flexa’s Chief Compliance Officer, highlighted the potential impact of pro-crypto lobbies and the banking industry. Perianne Boring, founder and CEO of the Digital Chamber, described the Democrats' support as a ""watershed moment"" for the Biden administration, indicating shifting tides favourably for crypto in Washington. 2. Federal Reserve’s Impending Policy Reversal - Inflation Pressures: The Federal Reserve is under increasing pressure to lower interest rates to stave off an economic recession. Despite inflation staying above the Fed’s 2% target, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) remains at 3.4%, with unemployment showing a slight uptick from 3.9% to 4% in May. - Market Indicators: The U.S. 2-year Treasury yield dropped to a 70-day low of 4.69% on June 14, reflecting concerns over economic growth. Concurrently, the S&P 500 reached an all-time high on June 13, as investors moved towards equities and other scarce assets to mitigate the effects of inflation. - Monetary Policy Adjustments: The Federal Reserve has indicated a cautious approach by slowing its quantitative tightening program, hinting at tentative optimism that inflation is stabilizing. However, the need for policy adjustments remains critical to prevent economic slowdown. Summary: The Federal Reserve's anticipated shift towards a more accommodative monetary stance could catalyze increased liquidity in the market, benefiting assets like Bitcoin. 3. Stable Bitcoin Derivatives Metrics - Recent Declines and Responses : Bitcoin dropped 8.5% from June 6 to June 14, testing the $65,000 support level. Despite this decline, its derivatives metrics exhibited unexpected stability. - Futures Premium Sustains: The Bitcoin futures premium, which measures the difference between monthly contracts in derivatives markets and spot prices, remained above 10% on June 14. This is within the bullish market threshold, indicating a lack of stress and minimal excessive demand for short positions. - Derivative Market Resilience : The derivatives market’s resilience, as shown by the stable Bitcoin futures premium, suggests strong underlying support at the $65,000 level amid broader market fluctuations. A confluence of favourable regulatory developments, anticipated shifts in Federal Reserve policies, and robust Bitcoin derivatives metrics underscores why $65,000 might represent a significant support level for Bitcoin. These factors collectively highlight a limited downside and bolster confidence in Bitcoin's price."
6/14/2024,"Bitcoin's 18-Month Rising Hashrate Trend Broken, Indicating Some Miners Are Surrendering","According to Odaily, Ki Young Ju, the CEO of CryptoQuant, has recently stated that the 18-month rising trend of 's hashrate has been broken. This development suggests that some miners are beginning to surrender. The hashrate, or computational power, of Bitcoin is a key indicator of the overall health and security of the network. A rising hashrate typically signifies an increase in the number of miners contributing their computational power to the network, which in turn strengthens the network's security. Conversely, a falling hashrate can indicate that miners are exiting the network, potentially due to factors such as unfavorable market conditions or increased competition. In this case, the break in the rising trend of 's hashrate could be a sign that some miners are finding it increasingly difficult to remain profitable and are therefore choosing to exit the network. This could potentially have implications for the security and stability of the Bitcoin network moving forward."

The second half of the bull market is just beginning, and there may be additional capital inflows and a strong rise in Bitcoin in the future."

6/14/2024,US Producer Price Index Impacts Bitcoin and Crypto Market,"According to U.Today, the release of the United States Producer Price Index (PPI) for May is set to influence a new growth trajectory for the market. This data significantly impacts both the broader traditional market and the and crypto ecosystem. The PPI reading is a key economic data point used to gauge the effect of inflation on the world's largest capital market. The month-on-month reading for the PPI was -0.2%, compared to the previous reading of 0.5%. This value, which is better than the expected 0.1%, suggests that the Federal Reserve's monetary policies regarding inflation stability have been effective. This could lead to a recovery in risk-on assets like Bitcoin. However, at the time of writing, Bitcoin has continued its bearish trend, falling by 3.76% in the past 24 hours to $67,351. This is a significant deviation from the mildly bullish momentum earlier in the week when the coin made significant strides to surpass the $70,000 price level. The current sentiment suggests that the digital currency may be reacting negatively to the news. A stronger PPI indicates a robust economy, which provides corporate investors with additional motivation to opt for traditional assets over risk assets. Despite this, the impact of spot ETF trading could alter the overall narrative. With spot ETFs actively traded in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Hong Kong, and Australia, there are ample opportunities to purchase the coin and potentially drive the price up in the long term. Despite the downturn, over 513 million Bitcoin, equivalent to $34,291,565,528, has been traded in 24 hours, representing a 17% increase. This could indicate a bullish shift that may contribute to the BTC recovery challenge."
6/15/2024,Bitcoin Faces Massive Sell-Off As Miners And Whales Unload $4.1 Billion,"According to U.Today, cryptocurrency analyst and trader Ali Martinez has reported a significant sell-off recently. Large cryptocurrency whales and miners have reportedly sold Bitcoin worth over four billion U.S. dollars. Data from the Santiment on-chain data agency was used to illustrate this. In the last 10 days, whales have offloaded more than 50,000 BTC, valued at approximately $3.30 billion. Additionally, Bitcoin miners have sold over 1,200 BTC, worth nearly $80 million. These two groups have collectively disposed of over $4 billion worth of Bitcoin. Miners regularly sell BTC to cover operational expenses and cash out profits from the mining business, especially when Bitcoin hits a new local high. Over the past week, Bitcoin, the world's leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has seen a nearly 9% drop, falling from $71,655 to $65,228. As of the time of writing, BTC has managed a slight recovery, adding 1.48% and trading at $66,160. Cryptocurrency trader and entrepreneur Willy Woo suggests that old holders, referred to as 'original gangsters' or ' ', are actively selling BTC. He stated that this pattern is as old as the genesis block and that they sell into every bull market. Despite the sell-off, many large players continue to buy BTC. According to an earlier tweet from Ali, whales withdrew roughly $1 billion worth of Bitcoin from crypto exchanges within 48 hours, equating to 14,140 BTC."

Bitcoin is testing critical support levels at $65,000, with lower levels such as $60,000 and even $48,000 in sight if additional downward pressure persists. Key realized price levels for various hodler cohorts provide important benchmarks to watch. Traders and investors should stay vigilant as market dynamics unfold."
6/15/2024,MicroStrategy Plans To Raise $700 Million Through Debt Offering For Bitcoin Purchase,"According to U.Today, MicroStrategy, a business intelligence firm headed by Michael Saylor, has disclosed the pricing of its latest debt offering. The firm aims to raise $700 million by issuing convertible senior notes due in 2032. The raised funds will be used to buy more and cover general corporate expenses.

Investors will have the choice to convert the notes into cash, shares of MicroStrategy's class A common stock, or a combination of both. The initial conversion rate is approximately 0.4894 MSTR shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes, which translates to an initial conversion price of about $2,043.32 per share.

6/15/2024,"Bitcoin Mining Intensifies, Bitfarms Sees Stock Surge","According to Odaily, in its strategic report, 10x Research has identified Bitfarms as a major beneficiary of the ongoing consolidation in the mining industry. Since the report's release, Bitfarms' stock has soared by 25%. Other popular mining stocks, such as Bitdeer, have also performed well, with a 61% increase within two weeks. However, 10x Research still advises investors to proceed with caution. Bitcoin has seen a slight decrease of 1% in these two weeks, failing to break through the resistance of $71,946. While stocks of crypto mining companies like Bitfarms may continue to rise, the preference is to invest under a potential bullish trend of Bitcoin, which is not the current situation. The self-reinforcing Bitcoin mechanism generated less liquidity in February and March. Despite MicroStrategy's announcement of a proposed private issuance of $500 million in convertible preferred notes to purchase more , the market reaction has been relatively calm. This is in contrast to the fourth quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024, when such news led to a significant increase in retail speculation and a rise in funding rates."
6/15/2024,Bitcoin Spot ETFs in the US Witness Net Outflow of $580.6 Million,"According to BlockBeats, data from Farside Investors on June 15 reveals that spot ETFs in the United States have experienced a net outflow of $580.6 million this week. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) accounted for a significant portion of this outflow, with a net outflow of $274 million. On the other hand, BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) saw a net inflow of $41.6 million. This data indicates a shift in investor sentiment towards Bitcoin ETFs, with more investors pulling out than investing in these funds. The significant outflow from GBTC suggests that investors are moving their funds elsewhere, possibly due to market volatility or changing investment strategies. However, the net inflow into BlackRock's IBIT indicates that some investors still see potential in Bitcoin ETFs. It's important to note that these figures represent the net movement of funds, not the total amount invested or withdrawn. The net outflow or inflow is calculated by subtracting the amount of money withdrawn from the amount of money invested. Therefore, even though there was a net outflow, it does not necessarily mean that all investors are pulling out of ETFs. Some are still investing, as evidenced by the net inflow into BlackRock's IBIT."
6/15/2024,"Bitcoin's Price Surge Not Over Yet, Says 'Rich Dad Poor Dad' Author","According to U.Today, Robert Kiyosaki, the financial educator and author of the popular finance management book 'Rich Dad Poor Dad', has made a bullish prediction about 's price. He expressed his frustration at the common excuse he hears from people reluctant to invest in Bitcoin, which is that they find it too expensive. Despite the high trading value of Bitcoin, Kiyosaki believes that it will surge even higher. He quoted his book, stating that 'Your profit is made when you buy…Not when you sell.' He also mentioned that many people wish they had bought Bitcoin when it was worth just $10, but those days are long gone. Kiyosaki recently predicted that Bitcoin could reach as high as $350,000 by mid-August or at some point in 2024. However, he clarified that this is not a prediction, but his opinion. He also revealed that he continues to buy Bitcoin, Ethereum, and , not because he is certain of these digital currencies, but because he does not trust the current U.S. government and its fiscal policies. In response to Kiyosaki's tweet, trader and entrepreneur Willy Woo pointed out that the run will end when everyone is invested in it. He revealed that so far, 4.7% of the free capital on the market has been invested in Bitcoin by financial institutions. According to , Bitcoin is currently winning, which he stated is 'exactly what VCs do for emerging tech.'"
6/16/2024,Bitcoin ETFs Gradually Gaining Acceptance Among Financial Advisors,"According to CNBC, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which launched in January, are slowly being adopted by financial advisors, says Samara Cohen of BlackRock. Currently, around 80% of Bitcoin ETF purchases are likely made by self-directed investors through online brokerage accounts. The iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) was one of the funds that debuted earlier this year. Cohen, who is BlackRock's chief investment officer of ETF and index investments, mentioned that hedge funds and brokerages have also been buyers, as per last quarter's 13-F filings. However, registered investment advisors have been more cautious. CNBC recently surveyed its Advisor Council to understand their hesitance towards these new products, which offer a regulated and familiar investment product for a new asset class that has attracted significant interest in recent years. The reasons varied from Bitcoin's infamous price volatility to the cryptocurrency being too new to have a substantial track record. Regulatory compliance and the crypto's reputation for fraud and scandal were also concerns for advisors. Cohen referred to these cautious financial advisors as 'wary', stating that their job is to construct portfolios, perform risk analysis and due diligence. Cohen views ETFs as a bridge between crypto and traditional finance, especially for investors interested in allocating to Bitcoin without having to manage their risk across two different ecosystems. Prior to the ETFs, the existing entry points into crypto were insufficient for some investors' needs. Alesia Haas, Coinbase's chief financial officer, stated that Bitcoin is 'on a slow journey of adoption'. Blue Macellari, head of digital assets strategy for T.

6/18/2024,Bitcoin Hashrate and Difficulty Expected to Fall During North American Summer,"According to CoinDesk, 's hashrate and difficulty may decrease during the North American summer months as miners scale back some of their operations. This reduction in competition could provide some relief to miners who are already experiencing a profit squeeze due to the halving event, which cut Bitcoin mining rewards by 50%. The relentless growth of Bitcoin's hashrate, or the computing power of the network, may finally slow down, providing miners with some respite as extreme summer heatwaves force the curtailment of some operations. Miners have seen their profit margins shrink in an already saturated sector after the halving reduced their mining rewards by 50%, while the hashrate continued to reach new all-time highs. The main reasons for the growing hashrate include previously purchased mining rigs coming online and miners scrambling to upgrade their fleet with more efficient rigs to remain profitable after the halving. However, this relentless growth is expected to slow down over the next few months as North America enters the summer with its associated heatwaves. Miners use extremely powerful machines that generate a lot of heat due to their computations. 'The number one operational challenge for miners is heat mitigation,' said analysts at Blockware Intelligence. 'ASICs are large, powerful computers that can reach very high temperatures without proper cooling measures in place.' This heat mitigation becomes an even greater issue during the summer as companies require more power to cool their machines and/or shut down operations due to high demand from energy consumers using their air conditioning. 'Many miners have to curtail operations [during summer months] in part due to overheating, but also due to residential energy consumption reaching high enough levels to activate demand response clauses in miners’ power purchase agreements,' Blockware added. This seasonal phenomenon has resulted in a lower hashrate over the past two summers, and a lower hashrate means a decrease in the difficulty of mining a block. 'As we enter the summer months in the United States, we're keen to see if hot weather will force miners to curtail and thus suppress hashrate growth as we saw in 2022 and 2023,' according to a June 17 report by Colin Harper, head of content and research at Luxor Hashrate Index. In fact, the hashrate has already begun to decrease since reaching an all-time high in March. As of June 17, it is lower by 10% to 589 EH/s, according to Hashrate Index data. Since most miners are located in the U.S., particularly in hot Texas, companies in North America shutting down their operations will likely impact the hashrate growth. 'According to data from the University of Cambridge, roughly 37% of all Bitcoin mining takes place in the United States,' said Blockware. 'As summer continues heating up, it’s reasonable to expect US-based miners to have heat-induced curtailments.' The lower hashrate and difficulty could be a positive outcome for some miners as competition decreases for the summer. Additionally, some miners, such as Riot Platforms, will be able to earn extra income from the power grid by curtailing their operations as part of their power purchase contracts. 'If hashrate continues to stoop, then miners may be graced with a negative [difficulty] adjustment this week – here's to hoping!' said Luxor's Harper."

6/19/2024,Key Price Levels Could Determine Bitcoin's Short-Term Trajectory,"According to U.Today, 's price fluctuations have led the crypto community to closely monitor key levels that could influence the short-term trajectory of the largest crypto asset. Glassnode Cofounders, known as 'Negentropic', have suggested that Bitcoin enthusiasts should pay close attention to the $64,000 and $65,000 levels, which are becoming critical junctures for Bitcoin's price movement. Amid the current price dip, Bitcoin now shows potential to rebound towards $67,000, according to Negentropic. However, this level could create resistance, and surpassing it could set Bitcoin on a path towards an even higher target of $69,500. Conversely, the $65,000 mark is being viewed as a crucial psychological support level, one that could play a key role in maintaining investor confidence. Negentropic emphasizes the importance of the $65,000 level, not just as a psychological support, and encourages Bitcoin traders to monitor it closely. Despite the potential for dips to $62,000 or even $60,000, the market sentiment remains cautiously optimistic. As the market anticipates 's next significant move, investors and traders may want to keep an eye on these important levels to effectively navigate the current market dynamics. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was down 0.48% in the last 24 hours to $64,795 after dipping to lows of $64,555 in today's trading session. Bitcoin fell to a one-month low as outflows from digital-asset investment products and the possibility of higher-for-longer U.S. borrowing costs dampened the cryptocurrency market. As Bitcoin has dipped below the $65,000 mark, IntoTheblock reveals that on-chain data suggests strong demand levels down to $61,600. The closest significant support level, however, lies around $64,500, where 1.28 million addresses previously acquired Bitcoin."
6/19/2024,Bitcoin ETFs Experience Outflows Impacting Crypto Market,"According to CryptoPotato, Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in the United States have seen several consecutive days of outflows, reversing the trend from late May and early June. The outflows, worth more than $600 million, have affected the price of Bitcoin and the overall cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin's price dropped to a monthly low before recovering slightly. Last week, it was reported that the streak of consecutive days of inflows into the ETFs, which had lasted nearly a month, ended. This occurred last Monday when all US-based ETFs experienced minor outflows worth $64.9 million. The outflows tripled the following day due to uncertainty surrounding the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) numbers and the subsequent Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. Although the inflation data was promising, the Federal Reserve decided against cutting interest rates, resulting in inflows of just over $100 million on Wednesday. However, the trend has since changed, with the ETFs not seeing a positive day since then. In fact, more than $225 million was withdrawn on June 13, almost $190 million on Friday, $145.9 million on Monday, and just over $150 million yesterday. Fidelity’s FBTC has been leading the outflows, with over $80 million of withdrawals for four consecutive days. This has even surpassed Grayscale’s GBTC in this negative trend. These developments have negatively impacted ’s price movements. The asset failed to reach $70,000 on several occasions last week and dropped sharply to a monthly low of $64,000 yesterday. However, it has since rebounded and is currently over a grand above that local low. Altcoins also suffered significant losses yesterday, but most are now recovering. It’s worth noting that June 19 (Juneteenth) is an official holiday in the US, which means that Wall Street will be closed, and the ETFs will take a breather today."

Bernstein pointed out that cryptocurrency bear market theorists believe that the trading of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has ended. Most of the early allocations came from retail investors, and the majority of institutional demand is for 'basic cash and arbitrage trading', not new net long positions.

The spot Bitcoin ETF was first approved in the United States in January, significantly expanding the channels for people to invest in the world's largest cryptocurrency."
6/19/2024,"Bitcoin Expected To Reach $1 Million, Predicts Jan3 CEO Samson Mow","According to U.Today, Samson Mow, CEO at Jan3 and a well-known maximalist, has reiterated his prediction that Bitcoin will eventually reach $1 million per unit. Mow, who is recognized for his long-term predictions of Bitcoin reaching the $1 million mark, recently reaffirmed his stance on a social media platform. This year, Mow has doubled down on his prediction, in anticipation of the fourth Bitcoin halving that occurred in the second half of April. Prior to this, when the SEC officially approved the trading of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January, Mow repeatedly stated that these ETFs' daily accumulation of Bitcoin would ultimately lead to a BTC demand shock. He also suggested that the halving, which reduces block rewards by half, would result in a Bitcoin supply shock. Mow's conclusion is that when these demand and supply shocks intersect, they could potentially drive the Bitcoin price up to $1 million or even higher. Mow recently tweeted his certainty that will reach $1 million. However, he noted two uncertainties: the exact timing of this event and the speed at which BTC will surge to this all-time high. Mow also shared his belief that the chances of Bitcoin jumping from $70K to $200K are high. He suggested that the longer the market waits for a significant price movement, the higher the likelihood that BTC will experience a substantial price jump, potentially from $70,000 to $200,000 overnight. In related news, a recent report by the Santiment on-chain data aggregator revealed a significant three-day drop in the number of non-empty BTC wallets.

6/19/2024,Bitcoin Layer-2 Network Anduro Incorporates Portal To Enhance Utility,"According to CoinDesk, Anduro, a multi-chain layer-2 network fostered by miner Marathon Digital Holdings, has integrated the decentralized exchange (DEX) network to Bitcoin. This move aims to boost utility on the world's oldest blockchain network. Marathon, a publicly-traded company, started nurturing Anduro in February as a platform built on the Bitcoin network that enables the creation of multiple sidechains. The integration with a San Francisco-based fintech provider DEX network coincides with a renaming of the project to Portal to Bitcoin. The company, previously known as Portal, raised a $34 million seed round in March. It uses the Bitcoin layer-2 network Lightning to allow users to convert assets like into BTC through atomic swaps. These are peer-to-peer transactions where cryptocurrencies can be exchanged on different blockchains. This practice is common between Ethereum-based assets and on other blockchains, but is a more recent development on Bitcoin. Anduro's integration could introduce greater utility to and potentially provide additional revenue streams for miners, which explains Marathon's involvement. Anduro’s sidechains employ a process called merge-mining. Participating miners could earn Bitcoin-denominated revenue from transactions that occur on these chains while continuing to mine bitcoin on the base-layer."

6/19/2024,Will Bitcoin's Chart Follow Gold's Historical Patterns? Veteran Trader Poses Question,"According to U.Today, Peter Brandt, a seasoned trader, recently sparked a discussion among his 729,500 followers on X (formerly Twitter). He questioned if the current chart would evolve into a daily chart fractal similar to Gold's performance during the 2008-2009 or 2020-2024 periods. This question arises as Bitcoin's price chart shows an inverse head and shoulders pattern formation, a technical pattern often viewed as a bullish indicator. This pattern preceded Gold's breakout in the mentioned periods. The inverse head and shoulders pattern is a recognized technical analysis formation that usually indicates a reversal from a downtrend to an uptrend. It comprises three main components: the left shoulder, which is a price decline followed by a rise; the head, which is a more significant price decline, followed by another rise; and the right shoulder, which is a smaller decline, followed by another rise. Bitcoin is currently in the process of completing this pattern, forming the right shoulder as per the BTC chart shared by Brandt. This has sparked interest in the potential implications for future price movements. Brandt's question focuses on whether 's current chart will follow the fractal patterns of Gold during two distinct periods 2008-2009 and 2020-2024, which saw Gold break out from an inverse head and shoulder pattern. The veteran trader presented two Gold charts from both periods; the 2008 to 2009 era for Gold showed much more substantial compared to 2020-2024, which showed lesser gains. Brandt's question comes at a time of uncertainty, with Bitcoin falling to a one-month low as outflows from digital-asset investment products and the possibility of higher-for-longer U.S. borrowing costs weighed down the cryptocurrency market. At the time of writing, BTC was down 1.75% in the last 24 hours to $64,441. As Bitcoin's chart continues to develop, traders and investors are keenly watching for signs of which historical pattern it might follow. Whether Bitcoin will mirror Gold's performance from 2008-2009 or 2020-2024 remains to be seen."

6/22/2024,"Bitcoin Miners Struggle But Not Yet In Bear Market, Says Analyst","According to Odaily, James Check, Chief Analyst at Glassnode, has stated that miners may be struggling, but they have not yet fully entered a bear market. He noted that miners are adapting and adjusting their costs to become their primary source of income, forcing the industry to innovate further and apply effective capital management. They mine 10 Bitcoins and then sell 10 Bitcoins. The current Bitcoin hash ribbon appears to be in a reversal period, with block generation time being approximately 14 seconds slower than normal. This suggests a lower online hash rate and slightly slower block generation speed. At present, about 5% of the mining hash rate is in trouble, implying that Bitcoin miners are 'very likely' to sell some assets, but this does not seem to be a 'complete sell-off'. Check's comments come at a time when the mining industry is facing significant challenges. However, his analysis suggests that while miners may be struggling, they are not yet in a full-blown bear market. This is an important distinction as it indicates that despite the current difficulties, there is still potential for recovery and growth within the industry."

6/22/2024,"Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Increases Amid Lower Hashrate, Says Analyst","According to BlockBeats, James Check, the chief analyst at Glassnode, stated on June 21 that we are currently in a period of hash ribbon inversion, where block generation time is approximately 14 seconds slower than it should be. This indicates a lower online hashrate and slightly slower block generation speed. A hash ribbon inversion occurs when the 30-day moving average of the hashrate is lower than the 60-day moving average, indicating mining difficulty. This could be due to a variety of reasons, including increased operational costs, a drop in prices, or issues with miners' equipment. Check suggested that miners might be struggling at this point. They may not have fully entered the bear market level yet, mining 10 Bitcoins and then selling 10 Bitcoins. Miners must adapt and adjust, making fees their primary source of income, forcing further innovation in the industry, and applying effective capital management."

This development could have significant implications for the cryptocurrency market, as it could affect liquidity and price volatility. However, it is too early to draw any definitive conclusions, and further monitoring of the situation is required."
6/22/2024,Glassnode Chief Analyst: Bitcoin Network Experiences Hash Belt Reversal and Slower Block Generation,"June 21, 2024 - In a recent video, James Check, Chief Analyst at Glassnode, discussed the current state of the Bitcoin network, highlighting a ""hash belt reversal"" and a slowdown in block generation times. This key metric suggests miners face challenges, potentially due to rising operating costs and market conditions. Key Points from James Check’s Analysis Hash Belt Reversal : According to James Check, the Bitcoin network is experiencing a hash belt reversal, where the 30-day moving average of the hash rate falls below the 60-day moving average. This metric is a critical indicator of mining difficulty and overall network health. Block Generation Delay : Block generation time is approximately 14 seconds slower than the optimal interval. This delay indicates a lower online hash rate, meaning fewer resources are being dedicated to maintaining the network's operations, likely due to increased costs or reduced miner profitability. Implications of Hash Belt Reversal Causes of Reversal: - Increased Operating Costs : Rising electricity prices, higher costs of mining hardware, and other operational expenses can reduce miners' profit margins, forcing some to reduce or halt operations. - Bitcoin Price Volatility : A drop in Bitcoin prices reduces mining profitability, prompting some miners to scale back their activities. - Equipment Issues : Technical problems with mining rigs can also contribute to a decreased hash rate. Miner Strategies and Adaptation: James Check noted that miners are under significant pressure. Unlike full bear market conditions, where miners historically sell all mined Bitcoins to cover costs, current conditions suggest miners may need to innovate. They might rely more on transaction fees as a primary revenue source, prompting further industry adjustments and more effective capital management practices. Broader Market and Network Impacts Mining Difficulty Adjustment : The Bitcoin network periodically adjusts the mining difficulty to ensure that block times remain approximately every 10 minutes. A significant and sustained decrease in hash rate could lead to notable changes in mining difficulty, impacting network security and transaction throughput. Industry Innovation : As miners adapt to new financial realities, we might see advancements in mining technology and strategies to optimize operational efficiency. This could include the utilization of renewable energy sources, strategic geographical relocations, and investment in more efficient hardware."

6/23/2024,Bitcoin Retail Investors' Demand Increases Amid Price Decline,"According to U.Today, (BTC) retail on-chain accounts are showing interest in purchasing the cryptocurrency at its current prices. Over the past few weeks, this metric has increased by 7%, which analysts interpret as a positive sign. Despite the ongoing decrease in Bitcoin's price, there is a growing interest in buying from accounts with up to $10,000, according to macro analyst Axel Adler. This crucial metric for BTC price prediction has risen by 7% compared to the local bottom reached in May. Adler emphasizes that while it's too early to predict a full recovery, the increased interest from the retail segment is a positive indicator. His chart, derived from CryptoQuant's data, suggests that the dynamics of retail accounts' interest could be correlated with potential price movements. The peak of retail demand was recorded in mid-Q1, 2024, shortly after Bitcoin reached an all-time high of over $73,738 on March 14, 2024. Adler also noted that the rally of the first cryptocurrency will return as crypto whales are interested in reinvesting their . He believes that retail players will contribute to the market's recovery, and that the market will recover regardless of circumstances, as major players have the cash they obtained from sales in March. As of the time of reporting, 's price had dropped below $65,000, reaching mid-May levels, and was trading at $64,262 on major spot exchanges. Seasoned analyst and Bitcoin proponent Willy Woo also believes that Bitcoin's price run is yet to come. He analyzed the hashrate dynamics and predicts the capitulation of inefficient miners. Historically, miners with cost-ineffective hardware have left the segment after halving events. As the market matures and Bitcoin's net hashrate increases, the long-anticipated capitulation of miners has lasted longer than before. However, suggests that the end of this process, which has been ongoing for over 60 days, will signal an opportunity for the next phase of the Bitcoin rally."

6/24/2024,"Bitcoin Dominates Other Asset Classes, Despite Recent Performance Dip","According to U.Today, MicroStrategy co-founder Michael Saylor has emphasized 's supremacy over all other asset classes. Since 2011, Bitcoin's cumulative returns have soared to 21,372,237%, significantly outpacing the returns of gold, tech stocks, and other assets. On an annualized basis, Bitcoin has also outperformed every other asset class, with average returns of 148%. However, during this halving cycle, Bitcoin's price performance has been somewhat disappointing. The leading cryptocurrency is currently trailing behind the MicroStrategy stock and a number of mining stocks. Following the introduction of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in early 2024, the leading cryptocurrency reached its current all-time high of $73,737 in March. This bull run is considered unusual as the flagship cryptocurrency managed to exceed the peak of the previous cycle before halving. At present, is down 12.73% from its record high, and it remains uncertain whether it will be able to regain its current peak in the near future due to the absence of bullish catalysts. Earlier this week, the cryptocurrency fell below $64,000 for the first time in over a month. The cryptocurrency is struggling to restore its bullish momentum due to significant outflows from cryptocurrency investment products and ongoing inflation that is hindering further rate hikes.

6/24/2024,"Bitcoin Investment Faces Challenges, Says Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan","According to Odaily, Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan has expressed concerns over the past year's investment scenario. He pointed out that various mechanisms have artificially advanced future demand, with Grayscale GBTC being the primary culprit. As hedge funds carried out premium transactions, GBTC brought forward billions of dollars in future demand. Other mechanisms, including the bankruptcy of Mt.Gox and the confiscation of Bitcoins from Silk Road, have also played a role. These 'lockboxes' have kept Bitcoin prices higher than those in the free-flowing market, which was beneficial. However, these assets are now being unlocked, thanks to ETFs and the passage of time. As a result, Bitcoin must attract billions of dollars in new demand to maintain its current status. Hougan added that the market has already eliminated most of the pending issues, such as the stabilization of GBTC assets. However, not all pending issues have been resolved, resulting in pressure on today's cryptocurrency market."

Despite skepticism from some quarters, Mow remains confident in his prediction, citing the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January and the fourth Bitcoin halving in late April as key factors. Mow has a history of making bullish Bitcoin price predictions, often referring to the potential for 'Omega candles' or 'Godzilla candles' to drive the price up to $1 million per Bitcoin. Following the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs by the American Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), these ETFs began to accumulate large amounts of Bitcoin daily, excluding weekends, to back their exchange-traded products. Mow believes that this will create a Bitcoin demand shock. The only ETF that was losing daily was Grayscale’s GBTC, which allowed BlackRock’s IBIT to surpass GBTC in terms of Bitcoin holdings size. After the Bitcoin halving event, which saw the block size reduce from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC, Mow suggested that a Bitcoin supply shock had occurred. He predicts that the price of Bitcoin will skyrocket to $1 million and potentially higher when the demand shock meets the supply shock. However, Bitcoin's market performance has been less than recently. In the last 24 hours, the cryptocurrency has seen a significant drop, losing the $64,000 and $63,000 levels. Since Sunday, the Bitcoin price has decreased by 3.32%, falling from $64,345 to $62,190. Bitcoin miners continue to sell as much BTC as they can, creating high selling pressure that has been a key factor in driving the price down. Miners are selling their Bitcoin to cover mining expenses and secure their profits."

Data from Santiment reveals a 42% drop in transactions worth $100,000 or more, contributing to the market's bearish sentiment.  Key Market Movements Bitcoin Price Decline: - Current Price : Bitcoin has retraced from $64,685 to $63,422, further declining to $62,531 at the time of publication, according to CoinMarketCap. - Historical Context : This drop marks a significant setback as Bitcoin had recently been consolidating above $64,000. Bitcoin is down 2.92% over the past 24 hours. Source: CoinMarketCap Whale Transactions: - Transaction Volume : In the past two days, there were 9,923 Bitcoin whale transactions exceeding $100,000, down from 17,091 transactions recorded in the preceding two days – a 42% decline according to Santiment data. - Market Sentiment : The pullback in whale transactions is seen as a risk-off behavior, indicating a bearish shift among large-scale investors. Analysis and Insights Whale Behavior: - Risk-Off Mode : According to CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju, whale traders on derivatives exchanges are in ""risk-off mode."" This term suggests a reduction in market risk appetite, often leading to decreased trading volumes and increased caution. Source: Ki Young Ju - Inter-Exchange Flow Pulse (IFP): The IFP turning red indicates a withdrawal of Bitcoin from derivatives exchanges, which typically prefaces or accompanies periods of declining prices. This red signal reflects a cautious approach where traders avoid leveraged positions in uncertain markets. Market Sentiment Indicators: - Crypto Fear and Greed Index : The index dropped to a “Neutral” score of 51, its lowest reading in 51 days since Bitcoin dipped below $60,000. This metric is critical for assessing overall market sentiment, showing a shift from greed towards a more cautious or neutral stance.  - ETF Outflows : Bitcoin spot ETFs have recorded significant outflows over the past six trading days, peaking at $226.2 million on June 13, as per Farside data. This outflow further underscores the retreat in bullish sentiment among institutional investors. Contrarian Indicators: - Sell-side Risk Ratio : Despite the negative trends, some analysts remain optimistic. Glassnode’s lead analyst, James Check, noted that the Bitcoin Sell-side Risk Ratio has reached levels indicating potential market movement. This ratio suggests that potential sell pressure from both profit-takers and loss-holders has been exhausted, suggesting a potential stabilization or new directional move. Implications for Investors Short-term Outlook: - Market Caution : The current decline, coupled with reduced whale activity, signals a period of heightened caution. Traders and investors might adopt a conservative or wait-and-see approach, looking for stronger market signals before making significant moves. - Volatility Risk : Investors should be prepared for potential volatility as the market adjusts to the new sentiment and trading activity levels. Monitoring key support and resistance levels will be crucial. Long-term Considerations: - Investment Timing : The observed market adjustments might present buying opportunities for long-term investors, particularly if sentiment begins to shift back to a more positive outlook. - Economic and Market Indicators : Keeping an eye on broader economic indicators, such as inflation and interest rates, along with regulatory developments, will provide better context and guidance for long-term strategies. Bitcoin’s fall below $63,000, driven by a marked reduction in whale transactions, reflects a cautious market sentiment. While short-term volatility is likely, some analysts see potential for stabilization based on sell-side exhaustion levels. Investors are advised to stay informed and consider both immediate market conditions and long-term indicators."

Teddy's analysis indicates that the market could see a rally in the coming weeks. If history repeats itself, the bottom for this correction could be around $61,000. Teddy explained that every correction experienced in this Bitcoin bull run has ended on the asset's 21 weekly Exponential Moving Average (EMA). The EMA is an indicator that tracks the price of an asset over time, placing more significance on the most recent data points. Teddy believes that Bitcoin could bottom at $61,000 soon. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $61,500 after briefly dipping below $61,000 to touch $60,900. Despite the , some factors suggest the market may be in for more downturns. Last week, CryptoQuant revealed a lack of bullish momentum in the crypto market, as seen in low stablecoin liquidity and weak Bitcoin demand growth from large investors. The crypto intelligence platform also disclosed that Bitcoin demand from whales was growing at a monthly rate of 4.8%, but traders were still decreasing their holdings. Stablecoin liquidity recorded its slowest pace since November 2023. Furthermore, U.S. Bitcoin and investors, who are usually major driving forces during rallies, have had weak demand growth. The U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) market, which reflects the intensity of this demand, has experienced consistent outflows since June 13. CryptoPotato also reported that could lose more of its value as miners have not capitulated yet. Bitcoin miners have continued to offload their assets as operational costs, hash rates, and pressures increase. Analysts expect weaker miners to 'die' and hashrate to recover before Bitcoin can resume its northward movement."

Schwartz, who was an early investor in , revealed his personal approach to managing his Bitcoin holdings. He stated that he would sell Bitcoin whenever he needed to cover expenses such as taxes or purchasing a new computer. This strategy, he explained, was common among early Bitcoin investors and miners. During Bitcoin's initial significant bull run, Schwartz noted that many companies started accepting the cryptocurrency as payment. This trend was driven by early miners and buyers liquidating their holdings to cover real-world expenses. Schwartz said, 'More and more companies were taking Bitcoin during the first big bull run precisely because this was what everyone long (early miners/buyers) was doing.' Schwartz also sparked a discussion about the concept of being 'long' on a particular cryptocurrency. He proposed a scenario involving two hypothetical holders: Alice, who has recently sold a lot of Bitcoin, and Bill, who has not sold any. He asked, 'Which is more likely to be very long Bitcoin?' He then elaborated, 'The whole time you are slowly both acquiring and selling, you are long. Someone who constantly keeps selling a lot must either be very long or constantly buying.' However, Schwartz agreed that selling all holdings represents an exit rather than being 'long.' Schwartz also shared some insights about his and BTC holdings. He disclosed that he had sold some of his Bitcoin holdings in the past and that at the peak of his holdings, he had around 26 million XRP."

6/25/2024,Bitcoin Holds Steady at $60K Amid Massive Sell-Off Fears – Is a Drop to $50K Next?,"According to BlockBeats: on June 25, 10x Research tweeted that Bitcoin is currently severely oversold. Many opinion leaders are advising their followers to buy on dips while altcoins appear to be performing relatively stable. The 10x Research Greed and Fear Index is close to its historical low, a level typically associated with market bottoms. Key Points: 1. Bitcoin is Deeply Oversold: - Influencer Advice: Influencers are recommending buying the dip as Bitcoin seems deeply oversold. Meanwhile, altcoins are holding their ground relatively well. - Greed & Fear Index : The 10x Research Greed & Fear Index is nearing its lowest possible levels, often associated with market lows, indicating a potential buying opportunity. 2. Reasons for Bitcoin Sell-Off: Several factors are contributing to the ongoing Bitcoin sell-off: - Mt. Gox Distribution : Estimated $9 billion worth of Bitcoin distribution from Mt. Gox creditors starting in July. - German Government Sales : The German Government is reportedly selling $3 billion worth of confiscated Bitcoin. - Bitcoin Miners : Miners are selling approximately $2-3 billion worth of Bitcoin. - ETFs : Bitcoin ETFs are selling around $1.4 billion worth of BTC. - OG Wallets : Original Bitcoin wallets are liquidating about $1.2 billion worth of BTC. Hypothetically, this totals between $16-18 billion, comparable to the year-to-date Bitcoin ETF inflows. 3. Trading Signals and Market Predictions: - Sell Signals : Our trading signals have indicated multiple sell signals for Bitcoin. - June 12 : A new volatility signal predicted a decline when Bitcoin traded at $67,339. - June 24 : A price range signal indicated further declines when Bitcoin traded at $61,113. - Market Concerns : Despite some attributing the latest drop to Mt. Gox-related FUD and other influences, there appears to be a structural factor impacting the market. This could lead to more profound consequences and potentially deeper declines before a rebound from lower levels might occur. Additional Concerns: There's growing concern that more liquidity may exit the market, especially since the current price levels are near the break-even point for Bitcoin ETF buyers and miners. - ETF Buyer Price : The average entry price for Bitcoin ETF buyers is around $60,000-$61,000. - Mining Costs : The average mining cost for Bitcoin miners is approximately $60,000 per Bitcoin. Both ETF buyers and miners may continue to sell despite influencers' and speculators' optimistic outlooks. Currently, Bitcoin is holding steady at $60,000, but the question remains: for how long? A potential decline to $50,000 is becoming increasingly plausible given the selling pressures. Bitcoin is at a critical juncture, deeply oversold with significant selling pressures from various sources. Influencers recommend buying the dip, but underlying concerns about liquidity and market fundamentals suggest caution. The next few weeks will be crucial in determining whether Bitcoin can maintain its $60,000 support or if a fall to $50,000 is imminent."
6/25/2024,Robert Kiyosaki Plans To Buy More Bitcoin Amid Market Downturn,"According to BlockBeats, Robert Kiyosaki, the author of 'Rich Dad Poor Dad', expressed his views on the current market downturn on social media on June 25. He stated that while most people should sell their Bitcoin due to the market crash, he is waiting to buy more. Kiyosaki emphasized that all markets have their ups and downs, and many people have made a lot of money by 'trading' in the market, which means buying low and selling high. However, he pointed out that the problem with trading any asset is taxation, especially 'short-term' capital tax. His strategy is similar to Warren Buffett's 'buy and hold forever'. When asked what he does if he doesn't trade assets, Kiyosaki said he spends his time accumulating new assets, which is why he is a 'serial entrepreneur'. He is currently starting two new 'start-up companies'. Kiyosaki also offered advice for those feeling panicked by the market crash. He suggested that if the downturn is causing anxiety, it might be best to sell and hold onto your job, which is what most 'employees' should do. In essence, he said, entrepreneurs and employees are two sides of the same coin. He concluded his post by advising his followers to take care of themselves and do what is most beneficial for them, as difficult times lie ahead."
6/25/2024,Fundstrat's Tom Lee Discusses Factors Influencing Bitcoin Price Predictions,"According to U.Today, Tom Lee of Fundstrat recently appeared on the 'Odds Lots' podcast to discuss his predictions. Lee highlighted the unique nature of Bitcoin as an asset class, emphasizing its cooperative value. He explained that those who contribute to the Bitcoin network benefit from it, a characteristic that sets it apart from other asset classes. Lee's firm first wrote about Bitcoin in 2017 when it was valued at around $1,000. Fundstrat published a white paper at the time, identifying two main variables that determine Bitcoin's price: the number of active wallets and the activity per wallet. Lee stated, 'At that time, we made a simple projection. We said that in five years, by 2022, if the number of wallets went up by 70%, and activity per wallet went up by 40%, Bitcoin would be $25,000 by 2022.' Lee also praised as an 'incredible technology,' noting its security and the fact that it has never been hacked in its 14-year existence. He added that 'Not a single entry on the Bitcoin ledger is fraudulent.' However, he also acknowledged that over 80% of Bitcoin price moves are still explained by activity per wallet. Fidelity's Jurian Timmer has suggested that the underwhelming growth of the Bitcoin network could be the reason why the cryptocurrency failed to record record highs in recent months. On Monday, Bitcoin slipped below the $60,000 level for the first time in more than a month, touching an intraday low of $59,863, according to CoinGecko data. Despite this, Lee remains optimistic about Bitcoin's future, having reiterated his previous price target of $150,000 back in June."

NFTs offer more efficient and accessible markets for traditional financial instruments with transparent ownership and instant settlement. They are also being used to represent carbon credits, ensuring authenticity and helping combat climate change while adhering to regulatory standards. NFT technology is revolutionizing various sectors including music, video, ticketing, gaming, trade finance, luxury goods, identity, private credit, AI, physical goods, and even vehicle registries.

6/26/2024,MicroStrategy CEO Advises Buying Bitcoin Amid Market Uncertainty,"According to U.Today, MicroStrategy's chairman and CEO, Michael Saylor, has advised investors to 'Buy before you need it.' amid the current market uncertainty. This advice comes as Bitcoin's price faces instability, dropping to lows not seen in over a month. In the past two weeks, Bitcoin has seen a decline of up to 8%, reaching a low of $58,414 on Monday, marking the worst intraday drop since April 13. Bitcoin has been affected by two weeks of outflows from exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that hold the cryptocurrency. A recent report from CoinShares revealed that Bitcoin investment products saw outflows of approximately $600 million for the second week in a row. This is the highest in two weeks since January when ETFs were approved in the U.S. Adding to the market's concerns is the announcement from the rehabilitation trustee of Mt. Gox, a Japanese crypto exchange that was hacked over a decade ago. The trustee stated that repayments of and would begin in July. Uncertainties surrounding monetary policy, including worries about the Federal Reserve's ability to quickly lower interest rates from a two-decade high, have also contributed to the crypto market's downturn. At the time of writing, Bitcoin had slightly recovered and was up 0.41% in the last 24 hours to $61,134. Investors are now looking forward to this week's economic data releases and comments from Federal Reserve officials. There are ongoing questions about when the first interest rate cut will take place. As the market waits to see what happens next with the Bitcoin price, Saylor's advice serves as a reminder of the importance of strategic planning in times of market uncertainty."

6/26/2024,"Stablecoins Show Significant Growth, USDC Deposits Indicate Potential Market Recovery","According to CryptoPotato, stablecoins have experienced substantial growth this year, with USDT leading the pack. However, other stablecoins like the Circle-backed are also witnessing considerable activity. Recent deposits of USDC to centralized crypto exchanges could indicate investors capitalizing on lower cryptocurrency prices during recent market corrections. Lucan Outumuro, Head of Research at IntoTheBlock, reported that USDC's net inflow into centralized crypto exchanges hit a one-year high of $228 million on June 24. This increase suggests that investors are depositing stablecoins to take advantage of lower cryptocurrency prices. CryptoQuant co-founder Ki Young Ju further validated this trend, noting that while the stablecoin market is growing, its ratio to 's market mirrors previous all-time highs. The exchange reserves ratio also suggests that stablecoins have already been used as buy-side liquidity, implying that new inflows are needed for stablecoins to drive the next market upswing. Despite Bitcoin's disappointing trajectory over the past month, these declines may present unique long-term buying opportunities for market players. Indications of recovery include the US spot Bitcoin ETF's minor inflow of $31 million, reversing the week-long outflow streak. On the technical side, Bitcoin's RSI has moved from heavily oversold levels to around 33, suggesting significant potential for growth for the world's largest digital asset. Experts also suggest the formation of a hidden bullish divergence for Bitcoin on the daily RSI, indicating that the asset could potentially be on the cusp of a bullish breakout."
6/26/2024,Three Methods To Implement Decentralization In Startups,"According to Odaily, a16z Crypto has published an article outlining three main frameworks for implementing decentralization in startups. The first is technological decentralization, where blockchain and smart contract protocols create an autonomous ecosystem that doesn't require trust. The main obstacle to achieving technological decentralization depends on the type of protocol being developed. The second framework is economic decentralization. This becomes necessary when one person accumulates too much value or can control the network by manipulating token prices, which could jeopardize the system's security and usability. The third method is legal decentralization, which can eliminate some risks associated with asset transactions. The article also discusses how to handle digital assets in Web3. If a Web3 system can eliminate significant information asymmetry and dependence on management, it can be considered sufficiently decentralized to no longer require compliance with securities laws. However, when it comes to legal decentralization, founders often find themselves confused due to the lack of clear rules, as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has not yet established these rules in a very explicit manner."
6/26/2024,"Tron Network Daily Active Addresses Surge, Leading Among Layer 1 Networks","According to BlockBeats, the network has seen a steady increase in daily active addresses since the beginning of the year, currently nearing 2.5 million. This places it at the top of the Layer 1 network rankings. The Tron network, a decentralized platform aimed at sharing digital content, has been experiencing a significant rise in user activity. The number of daily active addresses, a key indicator of network usage, has been on a steady upward trajectory since the start of the year. As of June 27, the number of active addresses has approached 2.5 million, marking a significant milestone for the network. This surge in activity has propelled to the top of the Layer 1 network rankings. Layer 1 networks are the underlying main blockchains, such as or . They are the foundation of the decentralized web, supporting a variety of applications and services. Tron's position at the top of this list indicates its growing popularity and usage in the blockchain community. The increase in daily active addresses suggests that more users are interacting with the Tron network, either by sending transactions, using applications, or participating in the network's governance. This growth in user activity is a positive sign for the network, indicating a healthy and active user base. However, it's important to note that while the number of daily active addresses is a useful metric for gauging network activity, it doesn't necessarily translate to an increase in the value of the network's native token. The value of a blockchain network is determined by a variety of factors, including the number of users, the volume of transactions, and the quality of the applications built on it."
6/26/2024,Bitcoin's Price Could Be Determined By Fractal Energy In The Coming Months,"According to PANews, the price of in the coming months could be entirely determined by the immense fractal energy if you believe in it. As we know, Bitcoin hit a historical high of nearly $73,740 in March, which is the peak of the current cycle. This could mean the bull market has ended. The trading prices of Bitcoin and fell by 5% today, causing almost all other currencies except stable coins to suffer losses, which certainly does not help to boost market sentiment. However, the problem with markets is that you never know when they will peak. Looking back, the historical high that Bitcoin set in December 2017 was obviously the highest point for the next three years, even though altcoins would continue to rise for a few weeks. In March 2021, when Bitcoin first broke through $61,000, it is still uncertain whether Bitcoin will plummet by 13% in November (only eight months later) after retreating nearly half. At some point, the bull market has obviously come to an end. Bears may have proposed this earlier than bulls, but in any case, the internal explosion of Terra in the next May and the subsequent cascading liquidation and bankruptcy are indeed nails. When it comes to price, all we can really do is look back. Since bottomed out in November 2022, 585 days (about 20 months) have passed, which we conveniently call the beginning of the current bull market. The chart depicts a comparison between bull markets. So far, everything is going well. Using this very basic definition, the previous two bull markets peaked after about 840 and 1,060 days. Therefore, if we are destined to repeat these periods—a big assumption—then we are firmly in the second half of the cycle. In the past two quarters, the price of has risen 6 times and 3 times respectively. Even after the recent decline, the return on Bitcoin since it bottomed out has reached 4 times so far, placing it in the recent bull market. If Bitcoin really peaked in March, then this will be the shortest bull market cycle on record, not including the first year of its price discovery."

Gox will start receiving compensation from next week. However, they may be reluctant to give up the tokens they have held for a decade. Off the Chain Capital CEO, Brian Dixon, wrote in the report that he does not anticipate an immediate market sell-off of these assets once Mt. Gox has completed its distribution. He noted that he has not seen many creditors selling their immediately after receiving it, as was the case a few years ago. This is because Bitcoin has matured significantly since Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy in 2014. Creditors must ask themselves whether they need this cash to purchase something, or if it would be better to keep Bitcoin as a long-term store of value, Dixon added. He also mentioned that Bitcoin has been the best-performing asset in 12 of the past 15 years."
6/26/2024,"Bitcoin Expected to Soar 10x and Rival U.S. Dollar, Predicts Crypto Trader Willy Woo","According to U.Today, cryptocurrency trader and entrepreneur Willy Woo has made a bullish prediction about on Twitter. He anticipates that Bitcoin's price will increase tenfold from its current level. 's prediction is based on the growing recognition of Bitcoin as a rapidly emerging asset class, a realization that has now reached Wall Street. He pointed out that asset classes are typically valued in the tens of trillions of U.S. dollars. If Bitcoin is now considered as such, its price should surge dramatically. Woo also suggested that Bitcoin could potentially rival the U.S. dollar in size and become a reserve asset. He believes this could occur when Bitcoin reaches a global adoption rate of 25-40%, which he predicts will happen in the 2030s. In related news, financial expert and advocate Robert Kiyosaki recently stated that Bitcoin is entering 'the Banana Zone.' This term, coined by former Goldman Sachs executive and investor Raoul Pal, refers to a period of exponential growth. Kiyosaki, the author of 'Rich Dad Poor Dad,' was persuaded to invest in Bitcoin by Pal several years ago. He purchased 30 Bitcoins when the cryptocurrency was valued at approximately $6,000. Kiyosaki continues to accumulate Bitcoin and hopes for a price drop to buy more. He recently expressed hope that Bitcoin could reach as high as $300,000 by September due to increased buying by spot ETFs and the scarcity caused by the fourth halving event in April."

6/26/2024,"Bitcoin Oversold, Indicates Potential Rebound, Says Matrixport","According to Odaily, Matrixport, a digital assets financial services platform, has reported that is currently oversold. Historical data suggests that an oversold status is typically followed by a certain degree of rebound. At present, the Relative Strength Index (RSI), a momentum oscillator used to measure the speed and change of price movements, has reached its lowest point since August of the previous year. Matrixport's analysis is based on the RSI, a tool that traders use to identify potential buy and sell opportunities. An RSI reading of 30 or below is generally interpreted as indicating oversold conditions, suggesting that the price may start to rise as the selling pressure eases. The current RSI level, hitting its lowest since last August, suggests that Bitcoin is significantly oversold and a rebound could be on the horizon. It's important to note that while the RSI is a useful tool in predicting market trends, it is not infallible and should be used in conjunction with other market indicators for a more comprehensive analysis. Investors are advised to conduct their own research and consult with a financial advisor before making any investment decisions."

These wallets reportedly accumulated a staggering $436 million worth of Bitcoin on Monday. This move is seen as a strategy to buy when the market is down, a tactic often attributed to legendary investor Warren Buffett. On June 24, Bitcoin's price dropped to as low as $58,456 due to bearish news about the upcoming repayments to creditors of the now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange Mt. Gox. This marked the lowest level for the leading cryptocurrency in nearly two months. The cryptocurrency market was gripped by fear, as indicated by the popular Fear & Greed Index showing its lowest reading since last September. The Relative Strength Index (RSI), a widely used momentum indicator, suggested that Bitcoin was oversold on both daily and weekly charts, a condition not seen since Bitcoin was trading at only $26,000. These factors suggested that the price was ready for a bounce, prompting major whales to buy more Bitcoin following the recent price correction. On Tuesday, the Bitcoin price managed to recover back to the $62,004 level, adding more than 2.2%. Pseudonymous cryptocurrency trader Rekt Capital noted that the flagship cryptocurrency has managed to successfully hold the key support at $60,600, which is the low of the current range.

6/26/2024,Tokenization Gains Momentum In Digital Assets Market Amid Challenges,"According to CoinDesk, the digital assets market is witnessing a significant transformation in 2024, with tokenization becoming a powerful new force. The entrance of heavyweights like BlackRock into the market is fueling this momentum, leading to a surge in the Total Value Locked (TVL) of these assets. This rise indicates an increase in investor demand, confidence, and interest, marking a new phase of adoption following the widespread acceptance of stablecoins in recent years. However, the tokenized assets market is not without its challenges. Traditional financial investors remain wary about product structuring and face liquidity issues in secondary markets. The complexity of trading and monitoring these digital assets post-issuance, coupled with the need for robust risk management processes, deters potential investors. For tokenized assets to gain broader acceptance, they must establish a robust infrastructure and provide a transparent product lifecycle. As the market supply progresses along the adoption , the lack of data availability, data analytics, and data quality significantly complicates the implementation of structured due diligence and monitoring processes for investors. This leads to varying risk exposures throughout the lifecycle of tokenized assets. These risks are evident in the creation of new assets, modifications to asset characteristics, the contractual terms of issuance, trading, custody, and the valuation of underlying assets. Investors need to understand the potential risks along the value chain and the intermediaries involved to mitigate risks and increase trust. Effective risk management involves continuous evaluation of technical infrastructure, compliance with evolving regulations, and stringent security measures for smart contracts. Clear property rights, secure custody of private keys, and accurate valuation through high-quality oracle services are also crucial. The integration of red-flag detection systems that leverage both on-chain and off-chain data, along with constant price discovery mechanisms, further enhances integrity and trust. The tokenized assets market is advancing rapidly, attracting increased interest from traditional financial investors due to innovative value propositions with new products and customer segments. However, significant challenges remain. Investors need to implement additional risk management processes, while specialized data providers and rating agencies are crucial for providing independent assessments. Through diligent oversight, monitoring, and continuous evaluation, these stakeholders can ensure the market develops securely, transparently, and in an investor-friendly manner, ultimately leading to broader adoption and integration into the global financial system."
